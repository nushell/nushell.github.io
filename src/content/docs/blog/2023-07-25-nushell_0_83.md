---

Nushell, or Nu for short, is a new shell that takes a modern, structured approach to your command line. It works seamlessly with the data from your filesystem, operating system, and a growing number of file formats to make it easy to build powerful command line pipelines.

Today, we're releasing version 0.83 of Nu. This release adds match guards, stronger type checking features, unit testing improvements, flexible variable initializations, and more.

<!-- more -->

# Where to get it

Nu 0.83 is available as [pre-built binaries](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/releases/tag/0.83.0) or from [crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/nu). If you have Rust installed you can install it using `cargo install nu`.

NOTE: The optional dataframe functionality is available by `cargo install nu --features=dataframe`.

As part of this release, we also publish a set of optional plugins you can install and use with Nu. To install, use `cargo install nu_plugin_<plugin name>`.

## Changes to commands

Since last release, some commands have changed and some have been created, here is a list of some changes and what they mean:

- [@amtoine](https://github.com/amtoine) in [#9646]: `which` returns the type of the command instead of only whether it is builtin or not and uses more explicit column names
- [@atahabaki](https://github.com/atahabaki) in [#9750]: `str expand` now allows empty member in _brace expansion_, e.g. `A{,B,C}` would expand to `[A, AB, AC]`
- [@fdncred](https://github.com/fdncred) in [#9669]: `keybinding listen` gives more information about keys like `home` and `end`, namely their `kind` and `state`
- [@NotLebedev](https://github.com/NotLebedev) in [#9453]: `input listen` allows to query for a single key press, e.g. the following will take a 4-char input `1..4 | each { input listen } | where key_type == char | get code | str join`
- [@kubouch](https://github.com/kubouch) in [#9687]: `path` commands lose the `-c` flag; instead, use `update` to update table columns

## Command set refinement efforts

Again with this new release, we are continuing refining our set of core commands. As part of this, another set of commands have moved to `extra`. Thanks to folks who are helping our efforts on the road to 1.0!

> **Note**
> No command has been removed completely, they have just been moved in the _extra_ feature of Nushell.
> simply use `cargo ... --features extra` to reenable them.

Math commands have been moved by [@stormasm] in [#9674], [#9657] and [#9647] and the following
commands have been moved in [#9404]: `fmt`, `each while`, `roll`, `roll down`, `roll left`, `roll right`,
`roll up`, `rotate`, `update cells`, `decode hex`, `encode hex`, `from url`, `to html`, `ansi gradient`,
`ansi link`and `format`

## Language improvements

Since last release, a few changes have happened to the Nu language itself.

### Declaration and assignment of variables

Until now, declaration keywords such as `let` and `mut` have required the use of parentheses around pipelines to assign the output of a chain of command to a variable.
Thanks to [@jntrnr] in [#9658] and [#9589], this syntax has been relaxed for `let` and `mut`. Let's give some examples!

```nushell
let filenames = ls | where type == file | get name
```

and

```nushell
mut my_var = "hello world" | str length
```

are now completely valid Nushell code.

> **Note**
> this new syntax does not work on `const` and it does not apply to assignment of values to variables, e.g.
>
> ```nushell
> $env.FILENAMES = ls | where type == file | get name
> ```
>
> is not parsed as valid Nushell.

Another parser improvement has to do with the use of `if` and `match` in variable assignment.
In [#9650], [@Windsoilder] made the following Nushell snippets possible:

```nushell
mut a = 3
$a = if 4 == 3 { 10 } else {20}
```

and

```nushell
$env.BUILD_EXT = match 3 { 1 => { 'yes!' }, _ => { 'no!' } }
```

### Input / output type checking and annotations ([@jntrnr])

Nushell as a language is more strictly typed than other shell languages.
However, not everything was type-checked nor possible to annotate and this new release tries to fill this gap a bit more.

:::note
in the following of this section, the term _input / output signature_ is used. This describes the input of a command and the associated output type of the command for the given input type, e.g. in `ls | get 0.name` the input type of
`get` is a `table` and its output type is a `string`, so we can say that the _input / output signature_ of `get` here is `table -> string`.

Please note that _input / output signatures_ always come in pair.
:::

First, [#9686] makes the input / output type signatures clearer in the help pages of commands.
Then, [#9690] and [#9680] enable input / output type annotations on custom commands and enforce a strong type checking
on the input and output of commands.
This means a few things

- the input / output of custom commands can be annotated

```nushell
def sum []: list<int> -> int {
    math sum
}
```

- some type-invalid calls to commands are now parsed as an error, e.g. `123 | get foo` gives the following error

```nushell
Error: nu::parser::input_type_mismatch

  × Command does not support int input.
   ╭─[entry #2:1:1]
 1 │ 123 | get foo
   ·       ─┬─
   ·        ╰── command doesn't support int input
   ╰────
```

This is still a work in progress, so some commands might have incorrect or missing input / output type annotations :open_mouth:
This is expected and we worked and are working on this to fix all incorrect signatures ([#9755], [#9749], [#9707], [#9706], [#9695],
[#9683], [#9775], [#9741], [#9742], [#9739] and [#9778])!

### Shoutouts

In between the two releases, [@1Kinoti](https://github.com/1Kinoti) has worked on some nice improvements to the language

- match guards have been added to the `match` command in [#9621](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/9621)
- `table` types can now have parameters, just as `record`s and `list`s can, thansk to [#9613](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/9613)
- structural subtyping has been improved in [#9614](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/9614) and allow to match structured types regardless of the orders of the fields

## Configuration tweaks

Contributions have been made to give a more consistent and sensible default experience in Nushell, both when using
the `default_config.nu` config file or when not having a config, e.g. with `nu -n`.
A better right prompt has been written in [#9585] and [#9581] and the default configuration has been polished in [#9676].

## The standard library

The biggest topic in this 0.83 release for the standard library has been the test runner!

Thanks to [@Yethal], the test runner of the standard library can now use annotations to decide whether or not to run
a command as part of the test suite of a project: [#9628], [#9622], [#9611] and [#9406].

For instance, we can now write a module as follows

```nushell
def add [a: int, b: int] {
    $a + $b
}

#[test]
def addition [] {
    use std assert
    assert equal (add 1 2) 3
}
```

and `std testing run-tests` would successfully run the `addition` test, no need to define tests with `test_` in their names!

Thanks to [@Hofer-Julian] ([#9607]), the standard library now also comes with a `pwd` command that tells you were you are in
the filesystem.

# Breaking changes

**PLEASE NOTE:** there are some big breaking changes in this release. These include:

- Removal of `let-env` (now use the `$env.FOO = "BAR"` form instead)
- Stricter checking of input/output types
- Transitioning of a set of commands to now be avialable via `extra` feature rather than default

Full list of breaking changes:

- [#9574](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/9574) remove let-env, focus on mutating $env
- [#9587](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/9587) disallow blocks as first-class values
- [#9589](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/9589) `let` no longer allows bareword assignment (Eg, `let foo = bar` where `bar` is assumed to be a string)
- [#9582](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/9582) make the behaviours of `last` and `first` more consistent
- [#9594](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/9594) Fix: return all headers with the same name from `http <method>`
- [#9646](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/9646) change the output of `which` to be more explicit
- [#9404](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/9404) [#9647](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/9647) [#9657](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/9657) - a number of commands have been moved to `extra`
- [#9680](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/9680) Input output checking
- [#9613](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/9613) allow table types to have parameters
- [#9687](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/9687) Refactor path commands
- [#9690](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/9690) The `extern` command has split into `extern` and `extern-wrapped`, the latter allowing a block to be called when calling an extern
