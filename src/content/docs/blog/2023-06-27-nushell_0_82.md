---

Nushell, or Nu for short, is a new shell that takes a modern, structured approach to your command line. It works seamlessly with the data from your filesystem, operating system, and a growing number of file formats to make it easy to build powerful command line pipelines.

Today, we're releasing version 0.82 of Nu. This release focuses on polishing the user experience.

<!-- more -->

:::note
Beginning with this release, Nushell is switching to a four-week release schedule. For details see our [special blog post](/blog/2023-06-27-road-to-1_0.md).
:::

# Where to get it

Nu 0.82 is available as [pre-built binaries](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/releases/tag/0.82.0) or from [crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/nu). If you have Rust installed you can install it using `cargo install nu`.

NOTE: The optional dataframe functionality is available by `cargo install nu --features=dataframe`.

As part of this release, we also publish a set of optional plugins you can install and use with Nu. To install, use `cargo install nu_plugin_<plugin name>`.

# Themes of this release / New features

## Nightly builds

We are pleased to inform you that we now have _nightly_ releases available for Nushell.
Feeling adventurous? Wanting to keep up to date with the latest revisions of Nushell without the burden of compiling the source base yourself?

You can find all available _nightly_ releases in the [release page of `nushell/nightly`](https://github.com/nushell/nightly/releases).

:::note
Please note that these releases are intended for testing purposes only, and we will keep only the last 10 nightly releases.
We highly recommend using the [latest stable official release](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/releases/latest) for regular usage.

## Custom datetime format ([@fnordpig](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/9500))

Until now, Nushell did not allow changing the default format of dates and times, leading quite often to undesired rendering,
e.g. seeing `A year ago` in the output of `ls` when one wants to know the exact time.

[`#9500`](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/9500) introduces a new config option to change the default output of dates and times:

```nushell
  # from the `default_config.nu` file
  datetime_format: {
    normal: '%a, %d %b %Y %H:%M:%S %z'
    table: '%m/%d/%y %I:%M:%S%p'
  }
```

## Support for comments in multiline pipes ([@WindSoilder](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/9436))

From now on, either in the REPL, in scripts or in modules, you can comment out any line of a multiline pipe without breaking its execution, e.g.

```nushell
ls
| where type == file
# | sort-by size
| get name
```

is perfectly valid.

This hopefully makes debugging and testing part of a pipeline much easier!

## Continuing cratification effort

On the road to 1.0, we have started moving commands around to make place for those which really matter.
As this process involves the creation of some new Rust crates, e.g. `nu-cmd-extra`, we call it _cratification_ :)

With this new release, the `bytes` commands have been moved behind the `extra` feature (use
`cargo build --features extra` to activate them back):

- [@sholderbach in `#9429`](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/9429)
- [@stormasm in `#9439`](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/9439)
- [@amtoine in `#9455`](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/9455)
- [@stormasm in `#9509`](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/9509)

Apart from moving less stable or common commands behind flag, this should also improve compile times for everyone.

## Splitting the `$nu` variable ([@jntrnr](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/9487))

Nushell 0.82 introduces a new familly of _stat_ commands, the `scope ...` commands.
These commands allow you to access some information about the current Nushell instance that were previously
available in the `$nu` variable! e.g. `$nu.scope.commands` now becomes `scope commands`.

On the other hand, `$nu` becomes much smaller and only holds simple paths and constants.

## Entering Linguist support ([@hustcer](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/9491))

With the efforts of [@hustcer](https://github.com/hustcer), Nushell is now an official language of Linguist,
allowing for better language support in GitHub.

## REPL: Mark line entries as excluded from the history by leading with a space ([samlich](https://github.com/nushell/reedline/pull/566))

In some situations you may want to avoid storing an entry inside your shell history. For example if it includes a secret or running it again in a different context could be dangerous.
To stop nushell from storing a particular line in its history you can now start with a space and it will be ignored. You can still recall your last entry once by pressing the `Up-Arrow` but the command will never be written to disk and disappear as soon as you submit another command.

# New commands

- [`http options`](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/9365)
- [`scope aliases`](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/9487)
- [`scope commands`](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/9487)
- [`scope engine-stats`](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/9487)
- [`scope modules`](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/9487)
- [`scope variables`](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/9487)
- [`scope`](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/9487)

# Breaking changes

- [#9509](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/9509) Cratification moves the `bytes` commands to `nu-cmd-extra`. They are thus only accessible with `--features extra`
- [#9496](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/9496) Clean up config by removing legacy options that were previously deprecated.
- [#9487](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/9487) Split `$nu` variable into `scope` commands and simpler `$nu`
- [#9427](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/9427) The filesize prefixes `Z`/`Zi` have been removed as their underlying values where not correctly representable.
- [#9407](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/9407) In the `ls --long` output the `uid` column has been renamed to `user` to be consistent with `group`
- [#9368](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/9368) Don't allow `save` command to save both stdout and stderr to the same file
