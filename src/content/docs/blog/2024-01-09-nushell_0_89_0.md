# Nushell 0.89.0

Nushell, or Nu for short, is a new shell that takes a modern, structured approach to your command line. It works seamlessly with the data from your filesystem, operating system, and a growing number of file formats to make it easy to build powerful command line pipelines.

<!-- TODO: write this excerpt -->

Today, we're releasing version 0.89.0 of Nu. This release adds spreading of argument lists to command calls, better editor integration, and many bugfixes.

# Where to get it

Nu 0.89.0 is available as [pre-built binaries](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/releases/tag/0.89.0) or from [crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/nu). If you have Rust installed you can install it using `cargo install nu`.

::: tip Note
The optional dataframe functionality is available by `cargo install nu --features=dataframe`.
:::

As part of this release, we also publish a set of optional plugins you can install and use with Nu. To install, use `cargo install nu_plugin_<plugin name>`.

## (Update 19.01.2024, Breaking change!) Removal of directory module auto-exports [[toc](#table-of-content)]

_Release note gremlin hid this note from us and we forgot to add it. We're sorry!_

[@amtoine](https://github.com/amtoine) in [#11157](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/11157) removed the directory module autoexport of all .nu files inside the directory. This removes the ability to "dump .nu files into a directory" and have them automatically exported. Previously, if you had the following file structure:

```
spam
├── bar.nu
├── baz.nu
├── foo.nu
└── mod.nu
```

all you had to do was to call `use spam` and the `.nu` files would be added as submodules of `spam`. Now, to achieve the same effect, you would need to put

```nushellshell
export module foo.nu
export module bar.nu
export module baz.nu
```

to the `mod.nu`.

This change adds one manual step you need to perform to export submodules from modules, but it gives you more control and confidence. In the previous system, .nu files would be auto-exported _even if you didn't want to_! For example, to prevent `baz.nu` from being auto-exported, you would need to put it inside a new directory that doesn't contain `mod.nu` (and thus is not considered a Nushell module), like this:

```
spam
├── bar.nu
├── foo.nu
└── utils
    └── baz.nu
```

We felt like this workaround was quite cumbersome, and the implicit behavior wasn't in the disciplined spirit of Nushell. Rather than having this auto-exporting as an _implicit_ feature of `use`, we're currently exploring ways to allow doing it _explicitly_, for example with a separate command.

## Spread operator for commands

In [#11289](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/11289), [@ysthakur](https://github.com/ysthakur/)
implemented a spread operator for calling commands (previously, it could only be used in list and record literals).

Now, if you have a command with a rest parameter:

```nushellshell
def foo [ ...args ] { $args | to nuon }
```

You can spread arguments to it like this:

```nushellshell
> let x = [foo bar baz]
> foo ...[1 2] ...$x
[1, 2, foo, bar, baz]
```

See [the docs](/book/operators#spread-operator) for more information.

## Editor Improvements

Thanks to @AucaCoyan's [#11284](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/11284) and [#11320](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/11320), Nushell's VSCode extension and builtin LSP server now show the same command's message on hover as abtained with `help` in Nushell.

## Deprecation of `--flag: bool`

In the last release, we allowed passing flags dynamically:

```nushellshell
def spam [--foo] {
    print $foo
}

let value = false
spam --foo=$value
# prints false
```

However, it is easy to confuse with `--foo: bool`. To disambiguate, we are deprecating the setting optional parameters with boolean type (`--flag: bool`). Doing so will trigger a warning:

```nushellshell
def spam [--foo: bool] { $foo }
Error:   × Deprecated: --flag: bool
   ╭─[entry #3:1:1]
 1 │ def spam [--foo: bool] { $foo }
   ·                  ──┬─
   ·                    ╰── `--flag: bool` is deprecated and will be removed in 0.90. Please use `--flag` instead, more info: https://www.nushell.sh/book/custom_commands.html
   ╰────
```

## Our set of commands is evolving [[toc](#table-of-content)]

As usual, new release rhyms with changes to commands!

### New commands [[toc](#table-of-content)]

#### `ulimit` for Unix-based systems

The new `ulimit` command added by [@nibon7](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/11324) can now be used on Unix-based systems for setting or checking the resource limits, such as the stack size or virtual memory size, for the current user.

To list the currrent limits:

```nushellshell
ulimit -a
```

Setting the limits is done via flags available in `help ulimit`.

<!-- NOTE: to start investigating the contributions of last release, i like to list them all in a raw table.
    to achieve this, one can use the [`list-merged-prs` script from `nu_scripts`](https://github.com/nushell/nu_scripts/blob/main/make_release/release-note/list-merged-prs)
    as follows:

    ```nushellshell
    use ./make_release/release-note/list-merged-prs

    const LAST_RELEASE = null

    let matching_releases = ^gh api /repos/nushell/nushell/releases
        | from json
        | where tag_name == $LAST_RELEASE

    match ($matching_releases | length) {
        0 => {
            error make --unspanned { msg: "no matching releases... did you set the last release?" }
        },
        1 => {},
        _ => {
            error make --unspanned { msg: $"too many matching releases... is ($LAST_RELEASE) correct?" }
        },
    }

    let last_release_date = $matching_releases | into record | get published_at | into datetime

    let prs = list-merged-prs nushell/nushell $last_release_date
        | where author != "app/dependabot"
        | sort-by mergedAt
        | update url {|it| $"[#($it.number)]\(($it.url)\)" }
        | update author { $"[@($in)]\(https://github.com/($in)\)" }
        | select author title url
        | rename --column {url: pr}

    $prs | to md --pretty
    ```
