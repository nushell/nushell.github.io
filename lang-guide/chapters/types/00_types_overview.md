# Types in the Nu Language

## Overview

Nu is strongly typed and gradually typed.

- **Strongly typed:** Types are strictly enforced.
- **Gradually typed:** A mix between static (types are checked at compile time) type checks and dynamic (types are checked at runtime).

  Gradual typing is a clarification of optional typing where the developer could choose or not choose to add type annotations to declarations. This paper from Jeremy Siek is here: [What is Gradual Typing?](https://jsiek.github.io/home/WhatIsGradualTyping.html)
