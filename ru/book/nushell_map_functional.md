# Nu map from functional languages

The idea behind this table is to help you understand how Nu builtins and plugins relate to functional languages. We've tried to produce a map of relevant Nu commands and what their equivalents are in other languages. Contributions are welcome.

Note: this table assumes Nu 0.43 or later.
