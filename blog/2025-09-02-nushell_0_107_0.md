# Changes

## Breaking changes

### `find` is now case-sensitive by default

The `find` command is now case-sensitive by default in all modes. Previously, you could use the `--ignore-case` flag to make `find` case-insensitive in the `--regex` mode, but the default "search term mode" would always be case-insensitive. Now, both modes are case-sensitive by default, and you can use the `--ignore-case` flag to make them case-insensitive.

This change makes the different modes of `find` more consistent. It also makes `find` more consistent with other parts of Nushell, such as `where`'s `=~` operator and the recent [case-sensitive cell-paths change](https://www.nushell.sh/blog/2025-06-10-nushell_0_105_0.html#case-sensitive-cell-paths-or-not-toc).

::: tip
If you want `find` to still be case-insensitive after this release, which might be desirable for interactive usage, you can add an alias to your config:

```nu
alias find = find -i
```

:::

### New behavior for `find --multiline`

Previously, `find` would always split multi-line input strings, making it impossible to perform proper multi-line regex matches unless a string was within list, table, or record. Now, the `--multiline` flag can be used to prevent this splitting, replacing its previous behavior of prepending `(?m)` to the regex.

Before:

```nu
"hello\nworld" | find -mr 'lo\swo'
# => no output
```

After:

```nu
"hello\nworld" | find -mr 'lo\swo'
# => hello
# => world
```

### `random dice` moved to `std`

The `random dice` command has been rewritten in Nushell and moved to the standard library. The `random dice` built-in is still available with a deprecation error, but will be removed in 0.108. The new command can be used as follows:

```nushell
use std/random

random dice
```

It's behavior, parameters, and defaults are the same.

### `each` now passes through `null` input

When `null` is passed to the `each` command, it now returns `null` instead of passing `null` to the closure.
For example, before this change:

```nu
→ null | each { "something" }
something
```

But after this change:

```nu
→ null | each { "something" }
null
```

### Execution Order of Hooks Changed: `env_change` _before_ `pre_prompt`

Before this release `env_change` hooks would execute _after_ `pre_prompt` hooks, and the prompt would be rendered after `env_change` hooks.

This meant `env_change` hooks got _in between_ `pre_prompt` hooks and `PROMPT_COMMAND`.

Now, order of execution is as follows:

- `env_change` hooks
- `pre_prompt` hooks
- Rendering the prompt with `PROMPT_COMMAND`

### `query xml` returns scalar results when possible

Previously, `query xml` always returned a table, even for scalar results. Now scalar results will be returned as scalars.

Here's an example of where this would apply:

```nushell
open -r tests/fixtures/formats/jt.xml
| query xml 'false()'
```

Before this change, this would return:

```
╭───┬─────────╮
│ # │ false() │
├───┼─────────┤
│ 0 │ false   │
╰───┴─────────╯
```

Now, this will just return `false`.

### Use fixed column name for `query xml` output

Previously, the `query xml` command outputs nodeset results in a table with a column name corresponding to the input expression. Now, the column name is fixed. This should make it easier to extract values from the output of `query xml`.

Before:

```nushell
open -r tests/fixtures/formats/jt.xml
| query xml '//channel/title|//item/title'
# => ╭───┬───────────────────────────────────────────╮
# => │ # │           //channel/title|/...            │
# => ├───┼───────────────────────────────────────────┤
# => │ 0 │ JT                                        │
# => │ 1 │ Creating crossplatform Rust terminal apps │
# => ╰───┴───────────────────────────────────────────╯
```

Now:

```nushell
open -r tests/fixtures/formats/jt.xml
| query xml '//channel/title|//item/title'
# => ╭───┬───────────────────────────────────────────╮
# => │ # │             string_value                  │
# => ├───┼───────────────────────────────────────────┤
# => │ 0 │ JT                                        │
# => │ 1 │ Creating crossplatform Rust terminal apps │
# => ╰───┴───────────────────────────────────────────╯
```

### Change the output of `format bits` to big endian instead of native endian

While the most popular architectures use little endian, many people are used to reading binary numbers as little endian. However, until now, if you were in a little endian system, you would get:

```nushell
~> 258 | format bits
00000010 00000001
```

If you copied and pasted that as a number, you would get a surprising result:

```nushell
~> 0b00000010_00000001
513
```

Now, `format bits` always formats in big endian:

```nushell
~> 258 | format bits
00000001 00000010
```

### Add active column to `overlay list`

`overlay list` now returns table instead of list of overlays. Before, only active overlays were included in `overlay list`. Now, hidden overlays will be included as well, and there is a column indicating whether a given overlay is hidden or not.

::: tip
The ordering of `overlay list` is still preserved. If you run `overlay list | last`, you will still get the most recently activated overlay.
For migrating to the new behavior, you can update any usages of `overlay list | last` to `overlay list | last | get name`.
:::

## Additions

### New `watch --debounce` option

The `watch` command now has `--debounce` flag, which takes a duration value. This will replace the `--debounce-ms` flag which takes an int rather than a duration, and will eventually take over its `-d` short flag.

### Deprecate `watch --debounce-ms`

> TODO(release-notes): Move this to Deprecations section
> TODO(release-notes): verify link works after generating ToC

With the new [watch --debounce option](#new-watch-duration-option-toc), the `--debounce-ms` option is no longer necessary. Use `watch --debounce` with a duration value instead.

### Add `-h/--help` flag to testbin

`nu --testbin` has a new flag `-h` to show available \<bins\>

<details>
<p>

```
> nu --testbin -h
Usage: nu --testbin <bin>
<bin>:
chop -> With no parameters, will chop a character off the end of each line
cococo -> Cross platform echo using println!()(e.g: nu --testbin cococo a b c)
echo_env -> Echo's value of env keys from args(e.g: nu --testbin echo_env FOO BAR)
echo_env_mixed -> Mix echo of env keys from input(e.g: nu --testbin echo_env_mixed out-err FOO BAR; nu --testbin echo_env_mixed err-out FOO BAR)
echo_env_stderr -> Echo's value of env keys from args to stderr(e.g: nu --testbin echo_env_stderr FOO BAR)
echo_env_stderr_fail -> Echo's value of env keys from args to stderr, and exit with failure(e.g: nu --testbin echo_env_stderr_fail FOO BAR)
fail -> Exits with failure code 1(e.g: nu --testbin fail)
iecho -> Another type of echo that outputs a parameter per line, looping infinitely(e.g: nu --testbin iecho 3)
input_bytes_length -> Prints the number of bytes received on stdin(e.g: 0x[deadbeef] | nu --testbin input_bytes_length)
meow -> Cross platform cat (open a file, print the contents) using read_to_string and println!()(e.g: nu --testbin meow file.txt)
meowb -> Cross platform cat (open a file, print the contents) using read() and write_all() / binary(e.g: nu --testbin meowb sample.db)
nonu -> Cross platform echo but concats arguments without space and NO newline(e.g: nu --testbin nonu a b c)
nu_repl -> Run a REPL with the given source lines
relay -> Relays anything received on stdin to stdout(e.g: 0x[beef] | nu --testbin relay)
repeat_bytes -> A version of repeater that can output binary data, even null bytes(e.g: nu --testbin repeat_bytes 003d9fbf 10)
repeater -> Repeat a string or char N times(e.g: nu --testbin repeater a 5)
```

</p>
</details>

### New keybinding: `vichangemode`

You can now set bindings which change the Vi mode.
To do so send a `vichangemode` event with the `mode` field to set `normal`, `insert`, or `visual`

```nushell
$env.config.keybindings ++=
	[{
	    name: modechangetest
	    modifier: control
	    keycode: "char_["
	    mode: [vi_normal, vi_insert]
	    event: {send: vichangemode, mode: normal}
	}]
```

The available modifiers and keycodes, remain limited to single character bindings with modifiers. We don't yet provide access to the key-chord parsing of the vi mode.

### JSON column support for `stor` and `query db`

The `stor create/insert/open` and `query db` commands now support JSON and JSONB columns. This lets you store more kinds of structured data directly inside of an SQLite database without an explicit `to`/`from` step.

Here's an example of storing a simple table inside a `stor` database, and retrieving it as structured data with `query db`:

```nushell
# create a table named my_table with a JSON column named data
stor create -t my_table -c {data: json}

# inset a row into the data column containing a table
{data: [1 2 3]} | stor insert -t my_table

# retrieve the data column from the table as structured data
stor open | query db "select data from my_table"
# => ╭───┬───────────╮
# => │ # │   data    │
# => ├───┼───────────┤
# => │ 0 │ ╭───┬───╮ │
# => │   │ │ 0 │ 1 │ │
# => │   │ │ 1 │ 2 │ │
# => │   │ │ 2 │ 3 │ │
# => │   │ ╰───┴───╯ │
# => ╰───┴───────────╯
```

### New `random choice` command in `std-rfc`

The `random choice` command has been added as a new candidate for our standard library. This command can randomly sample a number of elements from a list:

```nushell
use std-rfc/random
[1 2 3 4 5] | random choice 2
# => ╭───┬───╮
# => │ 0 │ 3 │
# => │ 1 │ 2 │
# => ╰───┴───╯
```

### Add `str align` to `std-rfc/str`

The `std-rfc/str` module has new command in this release, `str align`. This command will look for a substring (such as a delimiter), and add padding so that it is in the same column in all lines. It can also take a range to only align any number of lines.

```nushell
[ "one = 1", "two = 2", "three = 3", "four = 4", "five = 5" ] | str align '='
# => one   = 1
# => two   = 2
# => three = 3
# => four  = 4
# => five  = 5
```

### Spread `null` into collections or arguments

`null` values can be used with the spread operator (`...`), behaving as if they were empty lists or records (whichever is appropriate for its place)

```nushell
[ 1 2 ...(null) ] == [ 1 2 ]

{ a:1 b:2 ...(null) } == { a:1 b:2 }
```

### `get`, `select`, `reject` can `--ignore-case` of cell-path

`get`, `select`, `reject` commands now have a `--ignore-case` flag, which makes the commands interpret all cell-path arguments as completely case insensitive.

### `watch` streams events

`watch` command can now be used to _return a stream_ of detected events instead of calling a closure with it's information, though using a closure is still possible and existing uses won't break.

In addition to this:

```nushell
watch . {|operation, path, new_path|
    if $operation == "Write" and $path like "*.md" {
        md-lint $path
    }
}
```

Now this is also possible:

```nushell
watch .
| where operation == Write and path like "*.md"
| each { md-lint $in.path }
```

### Extend nodeset output formats for `query xml`

`query xml` now can output additional information when it returns Nodesets:

- `--output-type` enables `type` column. It includes the node type found, e.g. `element` or `comment`
- `--output-names` adds `local_name`, `prefixed_name` and `namespace` columns
- `--output-string-value` (re)adds `string_value` column

If you're using any of the `--output-*` switches, and want `string_value` column to show up, pass `--output-string-value` explicitly. In the absence of any `--output-*` attributes, `--output-string-value` is assumed to be on.

### `--endian` flag for `into binary`

Previously, converting values to `binary` with `into binary` could only do so in the native endianness of your platform. Using native endianness is still the default, but with the `--endian` flag, you get to choose:

```nushell
258 | into binary --endian little
# => Length: 8 (0x8) bytes | printable whitespace ascii_other non_ascii
# => 00000000:   02 01 00 00  00 00 00 00
258 | into binary --endian big
# => Length: 8 (0x8) bytes | printable whitespace ascii_other non_ascii
# => 00000000:   00 00 00 00  00 00 01 02
```

Note that this only affects `int`, `float`, `filesize`, `bool` and `duration` (i.e. it does not affect `string`s, `date`s and `binary`). Likewise, only the individual elements in `table`s and `record`s are affected (not the `table` or `record` itself)

### Other additions

- The `to html` command has a new `--raw` flag, which doesn't escape HTML tags in the input. ([#16373](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/16373))

- The `bench` command in the standard library now shows a progress bar (or spinner) on terminals which support `osc 9;4`. ([#16245](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/16245))

- The `commandline edit` command has a new flag `--accept` (or `-A`) which immediately executes the resulting commandline. ([#16193](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/16193))

- `std-rfc/kv` commands now take an optional `--table (-t)` argument which allows a custom table name to be used. If not specified, the current `std-kv-store` table will be used. ([#16450](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/16450))

- Added information to the `run-external` and `help` descriptions that indicates these commands or any with the same names are automatically used for running externals and the `--help` flags respectively. ([#16493](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/16493))

## Other changes

### `http` subcommands now keep track of redirects

> TODO(release-notes): Move this subheading to Additions

The `http` subcommands can now maintain a list of redirects when using the `--full` flag. This will be stored in a new `urls` column:

```nushell
http get --full http://nushell.sh | get urls
# => ╭───┬────────────────────────╮
# => │ 0 │ http://nushell.sh/     │
# => │ 1 │ http://www.nushell.sh/ │
# => ╰───┴────────────────────────╯
```

> TODO(release-notes): make sure the callout below is in the correct format for the blog

> [!NOTE]  
> This may break edge cases which relied on a lack of a `urls` column, for example:
>
> ```nushell
> {urls: important} | merge (http get --full <...>)
> ```

### `http post` now sends body serialized as pretty json

Before, `http post` would serialize values as raw JSON. Now, the JSON will be serialized into the pretty format. Note that this increases the body size.

Before:

```http
POST / HTTP/1.1
Host: localhost:1234
User-Agent: nushell
Accept: */*
Content-Type: application/json
accept-encoding: gzip
Content-Length: 13

{"foo":"bar"}
```

After:

```http
POST / HTTP/1.1
accept-encoding: gzip
content-length: 18
user-agent: nushell
accept: */*
host: localhost:1234
content-type: application/json; charset=utf-8

{
  "foo": "bar"
}
```

### `http` commands will now fail on invalid headers

Before, non-UTF-8 headers would be silently ignored. Now, these will cause an error. Here's an example which uses two Nushell instances to demonstrate this.

In one Nushell instance, we create something resembling an HTTP server on port 1234:

```nu
[("HTTP/1.1 200 OK\r\nContent-Length: 0\r\nx-header: "| into binary) 0x[1F FF AA AA] ("\r\n\r\n" | into binary)] | bytes collect |
```

In another instance, we connect to port 1234. The `x-header` is not valid UTF-8, which now produces an error:

```nushell
http get --full --allow-errors http://localhost:1234
# => Error: nu::shell::network_failure
# =>
# =>   × Network failure
# =>    ╭─[entry #5:1:32]
# =>  1 │ http get --full --allow-errors http://localhost:1234
# =>    ·                                ──────────┬──────────
# =>    ·                                          ╰── protocol: http parse fail: invalid header value
# =>    ╰────
```

### Improved error messages for misspelled flags

Previously, the help text for a missing flag would list all of them, which could get verbose on a single line:

```nushell
~> ls --full-path
Error: nu::parser::unknown_flag

  × The `ls` command doesn't have flag `full-path`.
   ╭─[entry #8:1:4]
 1 │ ls --full-path
   ·    ─────┬─────
   ·         ╰── unknown flag
   ╰────
  help: Available flags: --help(-h), --all(-a), --long(-l), --short-names(-s), --full-paths(-f), --du(-d), --directory(-D), --mime-type(-m), --threads(-t). Use
        `--help` for more information.
```

The new error message only suggests the closest flag:

```nushell
> ls --full-path
Error: nu::parser::unknown_flag

  × The `ls` command doesn't have flag `full-path`.
   ╭─[entry #23:1:4]
 1 │ ls --full-path
   ·    ─────┬─────
   ·         ╰── unknown flag
   ╰────
  help: Did you mean: `--full-paths`?
```

### Improved default color theme

We changed the default theme to use the ANSI default color (`39m`) instead of white (`37m`).  
This finally makes the default theme usable in the context of light terminal color settings. On dark terminal palettes this change should have no impact.

<img width="1351" height="507" alt="Comparison of white vs default color on Solarized Light theme" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/db80fe07-0cea-4a4b-ba14-e6a31f29cfe1" />

### Reset content type for commands returning partial input

The following commands no longer preserve `content_type` element of the input metadata:

- `bytes at` - bytes 3..5 of an `image/png` stream are not valid `image/png` stream themselves
- `bytes remove` - when you remove some bytes, the content type likely becomes invalid
- `first` - first 5 bytes of an `image/png` stream are not valid `image/png` stream themselves
- `skip` - bytes after 5th of an `image/png` stream are not valid `image/png` stream
- `take` - see `first`
- `str substring` - a random string slice of `application/json` isn't likely to be a valid `application/json` value

### Additional changes

- `format date` will respect `$env.LANG` and override it with `$env.LC_ALL`. ([#16369](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/16369))

- `query xml` now has `xml:` namespace prefix available by default, without the need to specify it via `--namespaces`. ([#16472](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/16472))

- Required named parameters will now always appear before regular named parameters/flags in the `help` output. ([#16476](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/16476))

- Trying to execute a non-existent script file used to return a confusing error pointing to an internal source code path. That error now points to the script file argument in the commandline. ([#16273](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/16273))

## Bug fixes

### `input list` Plays Nicely With Styled Input

`input list` had some trouble dealing with ANSI styled inputs, such as:

- not resetting terminal styles after each item, leading to items' styles leaking and affecting how the following items are rendered
- in fuzzy mode, resetting the styles _a little too much_ after emphasizing matching sections

Here's a before/after comparison:

|     | Select           | Fuzzy           |
| --- | ---------------- | --------------- |
| ❌  | ![select-before] | ![fuzzy-before] |

### Fixed spacing of `help` examples

`help` command used to trim the outputs of examples, which could result in inconsistent white space:

::: info
Following snippets are generated with this config:

```nu
$env.config.table = {mode: light, padding: {left: 1}, header_on_separator: false}
```

:::

Before:

```
  Find and replace all occurrences of found string in record using regular expression
  > { KeyA: abc, KeyB: abc, KeyC: ads } | str replace --all --regex 'b' 'z' KeyA KeyC
  KeyA   azc
   KeyB   abc
   KeyC   ads
```

After:

```
  Find and replace all occurrences of found string in record using regular expression
  > { KeyA: abc, KeyB: abc, KeyC: ads } | str replace --all --regex 'b' 'z' KeyA KeyC
   KeyA   azc
   KeyB   abc
   KeyC   ads
```

### Fix highlighting of aliases to external commands

Aliases to external commands will now be properly highlighted as external commands.

### Prevent `detect columns` from creating invalid records with duplicate keys

Previously `detect columns` created records (rows) with duplicate key names under some circumstances. The resulting table behaved inconsistently with different commands:

```nushell
let data = "meooooow cat\nkitty kitty woof"
$data | detect columns
# => ╭───┬──────────┬───────╮
# => │ # │ meooooow │  cat  │
# => ├───┼──────────┼───────┤
# => │ 0 │ kitty    │ kitty │
# => ╰───┴──────────┴───────╯

$data | detect columns | get 0.cat
# => woof
```

Now, this will result in an error suggesting using `detect columns --guess` or `parse`:

```nushell
let data = "meooooow cat\nkitty kitty woof"
$data | detect columns
# => Error: nu::shell::failed_to_detect_columns
# =>
# =>   × Failed to detect columns
# =>    ╭─[entry #2:3:1]
# =>  2 │
# =>  3 │ $data | detect columns
# =>    · ──┬──   ───────┬──────
# =>    ·   │            ╰── tried to detect columns here
# =>    ·   ╰── value coming from here
# =>    ╰────
```

### Improve errors for subcommands without a corresponding parent command

Added missing parent ('namespace') commands to improve error reporting:

- `attr`
- `detect`
- `error`
- `query`
- `registry`

### Other fixes

- `where` should now error on row condition expressions which are not booleans ([#16175](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/16175))

- Stepped range literals where `..=` precedes the second value no longer cause a parser panic. e.g: `random int 1..=3..5` ([#16231](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/16231))

- The gstat plugin will show correct branch in detached HEAD if commit hash starts with 0 ([#16309](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/16309))

- Parse-time pipeline type checking now properly supports commands with multiple pipeline output types for the same pipeline input type. ([#16111](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/16111))

- In `explore`, cursor position and search highlighting works better on non-ASCII characters. ([#16325](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/16325))

- `path relative-to` works better for case-insensitive filesystems, this works on `Windowes` or `macOS`: `"/etc" | path relative-to "/Etc"` ([#16310](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/16310))

- `std help` displays better on binary examples. ([#16354](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/16354))

- `into sqlite` will respect `$env.PWD` rather than current working directory. ([#16349](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/16349))

- Arguments to external commands with subexpressions like `^/bin/echo ProxyCommand=($'hello')` are now parsed correctly ([#16346](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/16346))

- The index column in a table will get a highlight color if `$env.config.table.header_on_separator = true` ([#16377](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/16377))

- Errors which reference values originating from command examples in the output of `scope commands` should now be less confusing. ([#16395](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/16395))

- Short flags which require a value should now properly be tracked by the parser. Previously, something like the `-a` in `table -a` wouldn't be properly highlighted if no value for `-a` was provided. This also means that the `ast` command will now properly account for these flags. ([#16376](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/16376))

- Before, attempting to run an external command when `$env.PATH` was not set could result in a confusing error. This release improves the error. ([#16410](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/16410))

- Type errors involving boolean literals are now more precise. ([#16408](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/16408))

- Interrupting a script with `ctrl-c` now properly kills background jobs on exit. ([#16285](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/16285))

- Previously, a record key `=` would not be quoted in `to nuon`, producing invalid nuon output. It wasn't quoted in other string values either, but it didn't cause problems there. Now any string containing `=` gets quoted. ([#16440](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/16440))

- The error shown when attempting to run a non-const command in a const-eval context is now more precise. ([#16393](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/16393))

- Argument variables for custom commands no longer leak outside of their scope. ([#16262](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/16262))

- The `polars fill-null` command previously only allowed dataframes as inputs. Now, `polars fill-null` also accepts expressions as an input type. ([#16444](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/16444))

- Using `polars open --type tsv` will now correctly use tabs as the delimiter. ([#16524](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/16524))
