## Highlights

Wow! What a week!

- Huge thanks to cosineblast for the incredible effort in landing one of Nushell's most anticipated and highly
  requested features. Support for background jobs has arrived!

- A warm welcome to cptpiepmatz and Bahex as the newest members of the core Nushell team! Thank you for all
  you have done for our community!

- And Nushell is easier to install than ever with official `.deb`, `.rpm`, and `.apk` packages. See the
  [Installation Guide](https://www.nushell.sh/book/installation.html#package-managers) for newly added directions
  for Debian, Ubuntu, Redhat/Fedora, Rocky, and Alpine. Thank you hustcer!
