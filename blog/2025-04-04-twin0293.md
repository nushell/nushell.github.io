# This Week in Nushell #293

Published Friday, 04-Apr 2025

## Highlights

- Thanks to @LoicRiegel for two improvements `into datetime` this week - The command can now use a timezone flag when parsing a specific format, and it also accepts `float`s as input.
- A few additional improvements come to `into datetime` with the upgrade of the `human-date-parser` crate. While we don't always remember to call out upstream improvements, Nushell
  just wouldn't be possible without the contributions of numerous contributors outside and upstream from our repos. A huge thanks to these (usually) unsung heroes.
- @pyz4 improved the `polars cast` command to accept a decimal precision and scale. Thank you!
- @blindFS has enabled tab-complete for the built-in modules `std`, `std-rfc`, and their submodules. Woot! Thanks!
- And thanks to @vansh284 for additional exact-match improvements for completions!
- Finally, @mztikk added support on Windows for running scripts on the path.

As always, thank you to all the contributors this week!
