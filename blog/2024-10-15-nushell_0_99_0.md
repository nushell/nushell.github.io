# Nushell 0.99.0

Nushell, or Nu for short, is a new shell that takes a modern, structured approach to your command line. It works seamlessly with the data from your filesystem, operating system, and a growing number of file formats to make it easy to build powerful command line pipelines.

<!-- TODO: write this excerpt -->

Today, we're releasing version 0.99.0 of Nu. This release adds...

# Where to get it

Nu 0.99.0 is available as [pre-built binaries](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/releases/tag/0.99.0) or from [crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/nu). If you have Rust installed you can install it using `cargo install nu`.

## Handling stopped TUI applications

Thanks to [@nome](https://github.com/nome) in [#13741](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/13741), Nushell will no longer hang the terminal on unix systems if an external command is suspended (e.g., via `ctrl+z`). Instead, Nushell will now display a message and wait for any key press before bringing the suspended process back to the terminal foreground.

# Changes [[toc](#table-of-content)]

## Additions [[toc](#table-of-content)]

### `ls --threads`

With [#13836](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/13836), an experimental `--threads` flag was added to `ls`. When provided, this flag makes `ls` use multiple threads (the exact number is currently undefined). In some cases, this significantly reduces the running time of `ls`.

### `enhanced keybinding configuration` [[toc](#table-of-content)]

**Support for kitty keyboard protocol modifiers.**

Thanks to [@replcat](https://github.com/replcat) in [#13906](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/13906), keybindings in your config can now use any combination of the modifiers `shift`, `alt`, `ctrl`, `super`, `hyper`, and `meta`. Note that this requires your terminal to support the kitty keyboard protocol and for the config option `$env.config.use_kitty_protocol` to be set to `true`.

**Support for Unicode Code Points in Keycodes.**

Starting from [#14020](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/14020), users can now specify characters in the keycode field using their Unicode code points, in the format `char_uXXXX`, where `XXXX` is the hexadecimal Unicode code point. This provides greater flexibility when configuring keybindings in Nushell.

Specifying Unicode code points can help eliminate confusion when characters from different Unicode blocks look identical but have different code points. For example, by using `char_u0041` for the Latin `A`, `char_u0391` for the Greek `Α`, or `char_u0410` for the Cyrillic `А`, users can accurately define keybindings and avoid ambiguity in configurations.

**Key Feature:**

The current implementation does not restrict the number of leading zeroes when specifying Unicode code points. For example, the character `A` can be represented as `char_u41,` `char_u0041`, or even `char_u000041`. However, it is recommended to use four hexadecimal digits (e.g., `char_u0041`) to improve readability and maintain a consistent format across different configurations. This recommendation follows the standard Unicode representation and helps prevent ambiguity.

**Example usage:**

```nushell
$env.config = {
    ...

    keybindings: [
        {
            name: <command_name>, # name of the command
            modifier: none,       # key modifier
            keycode: char_u0391,  # Unicode code for Greek 'Α'
            mode: vi_normal,      # mode in which this binding should work
            event: {
                send: <action>    # action to be performed
            }
        }
    ]

    ...
}
```

### `input listen`

The `input listen` command now supports the kitty keyboard protocol and respects the `$env.config.use_kitty_protocol` config option. This was added in [#13892](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/13892) thanks to [@weirdan](https://github.com/weirdan).

### `random bytes` and `random chars`

`random bytes` and `random chars` now support file size values as arguments for the amount/length of data to be generated.

```nu
random binary 1kb
random chars --length 1kb
```

## Breaking changes [[toc](#table-of-content)]

### Standard Library

The internal storage location for the standard library, as well as how it is handled during Nushell start-up, has changed to improve launch times. While every effort has been made to ensure backward-compatibility, there may be some corner-cases in how other scripts and modules have imported `std` in the past.

If you run into an issue, try the following import pattern. Replace `log` or `formats` with the module name you are using:

```nu
# If the module commands should be "prefixed", e.g., `log warning "Hello"`
use std/log

# When the module's command names should be available in the current namespace
# E.g., `ls | to jsonl`
use std/formats *
```

Refer to the [Standard Library](/book/standard_library.md) documentation for more information.

## Deprecations [[toc](#table-of-content)]

### Standard Library - Directory Stack / Shells / dirs Module

- [#13842](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/13842): Starting with the next release, Nushell will no longer automatically load the `std/dirs` aliases at startup. In 0.99.0, using one of these aliases (`n`, `p`, `g`, `enter`, `dexit`, or `shells`) will result in a warning message.

  To disable the warning message and prepare for 0.100.0, add the following to your startup configuration (typically `config.nu` or `env.nu`, etc.):

  ```nu
  use std/dirs shells-aliases *
  ```

  See the [Shells in Shells](/book/shells_in_shells.html) chapter of the Book for more options.

## Removals [[toc](#table-of-content)]

### `decode new-base64` and `encode new-base64`

The `decode new-base64` and `encode new-base64` commands added in the last release have now replaced the previous `decode base64` and `encode base64` commands [as planned](https://www.nushell.sh/blog/2024-09-17-nushell_0_98_0.html#encode-new-base64-decode-new-base64-toc) with [#14018](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/14018).

### `group`

With [#14056](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/14056), the `group` command [deprecated back in 0.96.0](https://www.nushell.sh/blog/2024-07-23-nushell_0_96_0.html#chunks-toc) has been removed. Please use the `chunks` command instead.

## Bug fixes and other changes [[toc](#table-of-content)]

### Default config prompt

After [#13857](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/13857), Nushell will only prompt the user to write the default config files if the default config directory does not exist. After the first prompt, the default config directory is created regardless of the response so that the user is not prompted again.

### Mid-pipeline exit codes

Some internal commands collect their input which could trigger the non-zero exit code error added in 0.98.0. After, [#13899](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/13899) this has been fixed and only the final command in a pipeline can trigger a non-zero exit code error if it is an external command.

### Last exit code

Fixed `$env.LAST_EXIT_CODE` not being set to `1` for errors not relating to external commands in [#13954](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/13954).

### `try`

In [#13885](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/13885), a bug where `try` did not catch errors when assigned to a variable using `let` was fixed. In addition, an issue was fixed in [#13992](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/13992) where `try` would sometimes print values when it was not the last pipeline element.

### Parser bugs

Thanks to [@sgvictorino](https://github.com/sgvictorino) in [#14053](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/14053), several parser bugs related to strings containing equal signs has been fixed.

### `hash`

The `hash` commands supported binary input, but their command signatures did not say so. This has been fixed in [#13923](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/13923).

### `view source`

`view source` now sets the pipeline metadata to `application/x-nuscript` after [#13859](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/13859) thanks to [@Bahex](https://github.com/Bahex).

### `do -p`

Fixed `do` not waiting for external commands to complete when provided the `-p` flag in [#13881](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/13881).

### `format date`

[#14037](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/14037) fixed `format date` not respecting the current `$env.LC_TIME`.

### `save -p`

There progress bar for `save -p` now updates at a minimum of every 75ms. Before, the progress bar would update at every write, making it hard to read.

### Panic fixes

Thanks to [@sgvictorino](https://github.com/sgvictorino), panics due to empty record input for `inspect` and `explore` was fixed in [#13893](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/13893).

Thanks to [@anka-213](https://github.com/anka-213) in [#10395](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/10395), a parser panic regarding custom command arguments was fixed.

<!-- NOTE: to start investigating the contributions of last release, i like to list them all in a raw table.
    to achieve this, one can use the [`list-merged-prs` script from `nu_scripts`](https://github.com/nushell/nu_scripts/blob/main/make_release/release-note/list-merged-prs)
    as follows:

    ```nushell
    use ./make_release/release-note/list-merged-prs
    use std clip

    let last_release_date = ^gh api /repos/nushell/nushell/releases
        | from json
        | into datetime published_at
        | get published_at
        | sort
        | last

    let prs = list-merged-prs nushell/nushell $last_release_date
        | sort-by mergedAt
        | update url {|it| $"[#($it.number)]\(($it.url)\)" }
        | update author { $"[@($in)]\(https://github.com/($in)\)" }
        | select author title url
        | rename -c {url: pr}
        | to md --pretty

    $prs | to md --pretty | clip
    ```
