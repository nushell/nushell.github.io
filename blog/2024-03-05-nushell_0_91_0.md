# Nushell 0.91.0

Nushell, or Nu for short, is a new shell that takes a modern, structured approach to your command line. It works seamlessly with the data from your filesystem, operating system, and a growing number of file formats to make it easy to build powerful command line pipelines.

Today, we're releasing version 0.91.0 of Nu. This release adds changes to globing,
an overhaul to the plugin protocol, support for piping command stderr, and new commands!

# Where to get it

Nu 0.91.0 is available as [pre-built binaries](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/releases/tag/0.91.0) or from [crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/nu). If you have Rust installed you can install it using `cargo install nu`.

::: tip Note
The optional dataframe functionality is available by `cargo install nu --features=dataframe`.
:::

As part of this release, we also publish a set of optional plugins you can install and use with Nu. To install, use `cargo install nu_plugin_<plugin name>`.

## Handling globs for variables [[toc](#table-of-content)]

::: warning Breaking change
See a full overview of the [breaking changes](#breaking-changes)
:::

From this release, if you pass a string variable to commands that support glob patterns,
then Nushell won't auto-expand the glob pattern ([#11886](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/11886), [#11946](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/11946)).

For example, given `let f = "a[ab]c.txt"`, then `ls $f` will only list a file named `a[ab]c.txt`.
But if you want to auto-expand the glob pattern on variables, there are 3 ways:

1. Use the `glob` command with spreading:
   ```nushell
   let f = "a*c.txt"
   rm ...(glob $f)
   ```
2. Use the `into glob` command:
   ```nushell
   let f = "a*c.txt"
   rm ($f | into glob)
   ```
3. Annotate the variable with `glob` type:
   ```nushell
   let f: glob = "a*c.txt"
   rm $f
   ```

In that case, `str escape-glob` command is no longer useful, and it has been deprecated ([#12018](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/12018)).

You can check the [guide](https://www.nushell.sh/lang-guide/lang-guide.html#glob) and [book](https://www.nushell.sh/book/moving_around.html#glob-patterns-wildcards) for more information.

## Plugin protocol overhaul [[toc](#table-of-content)]

::: warning Breaking change
See a full overview of the [breaking changes](#breaking-changes)
:::

The plugin protocol has been redesigned to support plugins that operate on streams ([#11911](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/11911)). A new [`StreamingPlugin`](https://docs.rs/nu-plugin/0.91.0/nu_plugin/trait.StreamingPlugin.html) trait is provided for plugins that want to take advantage of this functionality.

The API for existing plugins written in Rust has not changed, but they do need to be recompiled with the latest version of `nu-plugin` to use the new protocol.

As part of this effort, several other aspects of the protocol have been improved:

- Plugins will now automatically refuse to run with an incompatible version of Nushell. This should greatly improve error messages in that case.

- Plugin custom values are now accepted nested within other values and as arguments. The previous protocol treated them as a special case, and they could only be used as input or output from a plugin command, and could not be nested within other values.

- Plugins are now expected to keep running until Nushell tells them to stop. Currently, we still run a new plugin executable for each command, but this opens the door for that to change in the future.
- The bidirectional communication is abstract enough to allow for plugins to have much tighter integration with the engine. Expect further improvements to plugins in future releases!

For details about how the new protocol works, please refer to the updated [plugins section](/contributor-book/plugins.md) of the contributor book, as well as the new [plugin protocol reference](/contributor-book/plugin_protocol_reference.md).

As a great example of a streaming plugin in the wild, [@cablehead](https://github.com/cablehead) has already created the [nu_plugin_from_sse](https://github.com/cablehead/nu_plugin_from_sse) plugin for parsing [server-sent events](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Server-sent_events/Using_server-sent_events) in realtime from an `http get` call. Kudos!

## Stderr piping support [[toc](#table-of-content)]

Nushell now supports piping an external command's stderr to another command ([#11708](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/11708)).

Let's say you want to pass stderr output to the `less` command, you can do this:

```nushell
cmd e>| less
```

In case you want to combine both stdout and stderr output to `less`, you can do this:

```nushell
cmd o+e>| less
```

For more information, you can check the [guide](https://www.nushell.sh/lang-guide/lang-guide.html#handling-stdout-and-stderr).

## REPL stability and panic recovery [[toc](#table-of-content)]

Thanks to the work of [@ayax79](https://github.com/ayax79) in [#11860](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/11860),
[#11935](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/11935), and [#11953](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/11953),
the Nushell REPL should no longer crash if a panic occurs and should no longer exit if some other error is encountered.
Besides being very convenient, this should also make Nushell safer to use a login shell, since panics would previously cause Nushell to crash on an attempted login.
Similarly, if a panic was triggered when loading a config file, then this used to prevent the REPL from starting.
Now, the REPL falls back to loading the default config files in this case.

Note that panics are still important errors/bugs, so please open issues and bug reports if you encounter any!

## Our set of commands is evolving [[toc](#table-of-content)]

### New commands [[toc](#table-of-content)]

Thanks to the work of [@devyn](https://github.com/devyn), this release adds two new commands related to streaming!

#### `tee`

Inspired by the Unix `tee` command, this command allows you to make a copy of a stream to a closure in the middle of your pipeline ([#11928](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/11928)).

Examples:

```nushell
# Get the sum of numbers from 1 to 100, but also save those numbers to a text file
seq 1 100 | tee { save numbers.txt } | math sum
# The exact opposite: keep the numbers, but save the sum to a file
seq 1 100 | tee { math sum | save sum.txt }
# Run an external command, and save a copy of its log output on stderr
do { cargo run } | tee --stderr { save err.txt }
# Filter the log output before saving it
do { cargo run } | tee --stderr { lines | find WARN | save warnings.txt }
```

The closure will run in a background thread in parallel, and it will only get a copy of values that actually make their way to the end of the pipeline. For example, if you cut the stream short:

```nushell
seq 1 100 | tee { save numbers.txt } | first 5
```

then "numbers.txt" will only contain the first 5 numbers as well.

#### `interleave`

This command supports consuming multiple streams in parallel, and combining the streams into a single stream ([#11955](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/11955)).

In contrast to `zip`, the values are added to the final stream as soon as they're ready, without any regard for fairness. There is no way to know which stream the values came from unless that information is embedded into the values by the closures being executed.

For example, the following `zip`-based pipeline will always produce output that looks like this:

```nushell
> seq 1 50 | wrap a | zip { seq 1 50 | wrap b } | flatten
╭────┬────┬────╮
│  # │ a  │ b  │
├────┼────┼────┤
│  0 │  1 │ ❎ │
│  1 │ ❎ │  1 │
│  2 │  2 │ ❎ │
│  3 │ ❎ │  2 │
│  4 │  3 │ ❎ │
│  5 │ ❎ │  3 │
...
```

Each number from `a` is always paired with a number from `b`. However, if `interleave` is used instead, it is not predictable in which order `a` values will appear with respect to `b`:

```nushell
> seq 1 50 | wrap a | interleave { seq 1 50 | wrap b }
╭────┬────┬────╮
│  # │ b  │ a  │
├────┼────┼────┤
│  0 │  1 │ ❎ │
│  1 │ ❎ │  1 │
│  2 │  2 │ ❎ │
│  3 │  3 │ ❎ │
│  4 │ ❎ │  2 │
│  5 │ ❎ │  3 │
│  6 │  4 │ ❎ │
│  7 │  5 │ ❎ │
│  8 │  6 │ ❎ │
│  9 │  7 │ ❎ │
│ 10 │ ❎ │  4 │
...
```

One advantage of this is that it is not necessary for both streams to produce the same amount of output, and whatever output is produced will be immediately available. This is particularly helpful for running external commands and interleaving lines from all of them:

```nushell
interleave ...(
  (ls projects).name | each { |project|
    {
      cd $project
      make | lines | each { |line| {project: $project, out: $line} }
    }
  }
)
```

This example would run the `make` command in every subdirectory of the "projects" directory, and gather the output lines in parallel.

#### `is-not-empty`

As a quality of life improvement, we have added the `is-not-empty` command in [#11991](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/11991).
It is the same as the `is-empty` command but negates the result.
This should hopefully eliminate the need for users to hand-roll their own `is-not-empty` command.

#### `commandline`

In [#11877](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/11877), [@kit494way](https://github.com/kit494way) improved the signatures for the `commandline` command.
Instead of using flags to perform different operations, `commandline` now has subcommands:

- `commandline edit`: to append, insert, or replace the cursor line (returns nothing)
- `commandline get-cursor`: to get the cursor position (returns an integer)
- `commandline set-cursor`: to set the cursor position (returns nothing)

These subcommands make certain flags unnecessary, and so these have been marked as deprecated:

- `--cursor`
- `--cursor-end`
- `--append`
- `--insert`
- `--replace`

### Changes to existing commands [[toc](#table-of-content)]

#### `zip` supports closures

When `zip` is passed a closure now, it will run that closure and zip its output as a stream ([#11924](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/11924)). With this change, it is no longer necessary for the argument to `zip` to complete before the result is available:

```nushell
seq 1 10 | zip { 1.. | each { $in * 2 } }
```

This would not have completed before: the infinite stream would have had to be on the input side of `zip`, because a subexpression would have been (attempted to be) fully consumed:

```nushell
# never completes, and probably eats up all of your memory!
seq 1 10 | zip (1.. | each { $in * 2 })
# works fine
1.. | each { $in * 2 } | zip (seq 1 10)
```

#### Migrating more commands to use `uutils`

Continuing the integration with `uutils`, this release migrates the `mv` and `mkdir` commands.
In [#12022](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/12022), we renamed the `umv` command to `mv`,
removing the old implementation of `mv`. Similarly, we removed the old `mkdir` command
in [#12007](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/12007) and renamed the `umkdir` command to take its place.

#### `bits` supports binary values

Despite their name, the `bits` commands used to only support integers and did not work with binary values.
[@astral-l](https://github.com/astral-l) has remedied this in [#11854](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/11854),
and binary values now work with the `bits` family of commands. Where appropriate,
some of these commands (`bits and`, `bits or`, and `bits xor`) now have an `--endian` flag to specify the endianness when operating on binary values of different lengths.

#### `into int --signed`

Thanks to [@astral-l](https://github.com/astral-l)'s work in [#11902](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/11902), the `into int` command now has a `--signed` flag for interpreting binary values as signed integers.
(The default behavior when converting binary values is to zero-extend.) Additionally, binary values longer than 8 bytes will now error, as this could overflow a 64-bit integer which is what Nushell uses internally for integers.

#### List spreading for filesystem commands

With [#11858](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/11858), `rm`, `open`, and `touch` no longer have a required positional parameter and now only have a rest parameter.
This should make spreading a list of files/paths to these commands more ergonomic.

#### Duplicate record keys now error

With [#11807](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/11807), `from nuon` now errors if duplicate record keys are found.
Similarly, with [#11808](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/11808), `lazy make` now errors if duplicate keys are provided.

#### Removing list of cell path support

`select` and `reject` used to allow lists of cell paths as positional arguments like:

```nu
let cols = [name size]
ls | select $cols
```

In [#11859](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/11859), this was removed in favor of the spread operator:

```nu
ls | select ...$cols
```

Or, one can still provide the cell paths directly:

```nu
ls | select name size
```
