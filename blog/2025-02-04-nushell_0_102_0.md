### Custom completers fall back to file completions [[toc](#table-of-contents)]

With [#14781](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/14781), custom completers can return `null` to fall back to file completions.

## Breaking changes

| [@132ikl](https://github.com/132ikl) | Add run-time type checking for command pipeline input | [#14741](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/14741) |
| [@132ikl](https://github.com/132ikl) | Don't expand ndots if prefixed with `./` | [#14755](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/14755) |
| [@132ikl](https://github.com/132ikl) | Rename `fmt` to `format number` | [#14875](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/14875) |
| [@Bahex](https://github.com/Bahex) | Run ENV_CONVERSIONS whenever it's modified | [#14591](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/14591) |
| [@IanManske](https://github.com/IanManske) | Improve and fix filesize formatting/display | [#14397](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/14397) |
| [@NotTheDr01ds](https://github.com/NotTheDr01ds) | Rename `std/core` to `std/prelude` | [#14962](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/14962) |

### External completers fall back to file completions only on `null` [[toc](#table-of-contents)]

With [#14781](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/14781), the external completer will fall back to file completions only if `null` is returned. The external completer used to do this for any invalid value, but completions will now be suppressed if a non-null invalid value is returned.

### Custom completions inherit `case_sensitive` option from config [[toc](#table-of-contents)]

With [#14738](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/14738), when matching suggestions from a custom completions, the case sensitivity setting is always inherited from `$env.config.completions.case_sensitive`. Previously, if a custom completer returned a record containing an `options` field but didn't specify the `case_sensitive` option, it would default to `true`.

This change doesn't apply to custom completers that return either lists or records without an `options` field. For such completers, `case_sensitive` was always inherited from `$env.config.completions.case_sensitive`.

## Deprecations

<!-- TODO: also add new/renamed commands to ##Additions -->

| [@sholderbach](https://github.com/sholderbach) | Rename/deprecate `into bits` to `format bits` | [#14634](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/14634) |
| [@sholderbach](https://github.com/sholderbach) | Rename/deprecate `range` to `slice` | [#14825](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/14825) |

## Removals

- `utouch` has been renamed to `touch` in [#14721](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/14721).
