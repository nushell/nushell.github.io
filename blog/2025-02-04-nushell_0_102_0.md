## Run-time pipeline input typechecking [[toc](#table-of-contents)]

::: warning Breaking change
See a full overview of the [breaking changes](#breaking-changes)
:::

Previously, the type of a command's pipeline input was only checked against the input/output types of that command at parse-time. With [#14741](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/14741), this check also now happens at run-time. While these kinds of errors can often be caught at parse-time, adding run-time checks ensures commands can't receive unexpected input values.

Here's an example command, which should only accept integer pipeline input:

```nushell
def cool-int-print []: int -> nothing {
  print $"my cool int is ($in)"
}

1 | cool-int-print
# => my cool int is 1

"evil string" | cool-int-print
# => Error: nu::parser::input_type_mismatch
# =>
# =>   × Command does not support string input.
# =>    ╭─[entry #12:1:17]
# =>  1 │ "evil string" | cool-int-print
# =>    ·                 ───────┬──────
# =>    ·                        ╰── command doesn't support string input
# =>    ╰────
```

The parser sees a string, and rejects the invalid input. Before this release however, if the parser couldn't determine an input was invalid, it would happily pass along the invalid value. In this example, the output type of `from json` is `any`, so the parser doesn't know we're trying to pass a string to `cool-int-print`:

```nushell
"evil string" | from json | cool-int-print
# => my cool int is evil string
```

After this release, Nushell will also enforce the allowed input types at run-time (notice the error starts with `nu::shell` rather than `nu::parse`):

```nushell
"evil string" | from json | cool-int-print
# => Error: nu::shell::only_supports_this_input_type
# =>
# =>   × Input type not supported.
# =>    ╭─[entry #18:1:17]
# =>  1 │ "evil string" | from json | cool-int-print
# =>    ·                 ────┬────   ───────┬──────
# =>    ·                     │              ╰── only int input data is supported
# =>    ·                     ╰── input type: string
# =>    ╰────
```

Because of this change, you may notice some new errors in your scripts like the one above. We've already adjusted the input/output types of many commands to better match their actual behavior (see [Command pipeline input/output type changes](#command-pipeline-input-output-type-changes-toc)), but if you run into an unexpected input type checking error, don't hesitate to file an issue!

### `generate` with input

In [#14804](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/14804), [@Bahex](https://github.com/Bahex) added input support to `generate`.
Without pipeline input `generate` works same as before.

With pipeline input, `generate`'s closure argument is supplied two arguments,

- an item from the input
- the `next` value from the previous iteration

This allows `generate` to act as a stateful `each` and more, filling the niche of a stateful _and_ streaming filter command.

#### `std/iter scan`

Thanks to the new capabilities of `generate`, `iter scan` was updated to be streaming. It is also considerably more performant with large inputs.

### New operators: `has` and `not-has`

In [#14841](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/14841), [@Bahex](https://github.com/Bahex) added two new operators: `has` and `not-has`.
They are analogous to `in` and `not-in`, with the order of operands switched.

This makes certain operations more ergonomic.

```nushell
[[name, children]; [foo, [a, b, c]], [bar [d, e, f]]] | where ("e" in $it.children)
# vs
[[name, children]; [foo, [a, b, c]], [bar [d, e, f]]] | where children has "e"
```

### User autoload directories

Previous Nushell releases added the `vendor/autoload` directories which were automatically sourced during startup. In
[#14669](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/14669), [@NotTheDr01ds](https://github.com/NotTheDr01ds) extended this to
include user directories.

During startup, any `.nu` files in `($nu.default-config-dir)/autoload` will be automatically sourced during startup. This occurs
after any vendor files have been processed, allowing user override of vendor settings if needed.

### Custom completers fall back to file completions [[toc](#table-of-contents)]

With [#14781](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/14781), custom completers can return `null` to fall back to file completions.

### `get` is now const [[toc](#table-of-contents)]

With [#14751](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/14751), the `get` command can now be used during [constant evaluation](/book/how_nushell_code_gets_run.md#parse-time-constant-evaluation). For example:

```nushell
const foo = [1 2 3] | get 2
$foo
# => 3
```

### `format number` (renamed from `fmt`)

The `fmt` command, which is used for converting numbers to a variety of different formats, has been renamed to `format number` in [#14875](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/14875).

### `chunks` supports binary input

Thanks to [@Bahex](https://github.com/Bahex) in [#14649](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/14649), `chunks` command now works on binary values and binary streams, making it easier to inspect and work on binary values and allowing partial reads from streams without collecting.

For example, while working with a binary file or protocol, you might need to convert an IP address stored as raw bytes to the more commonly used string format.

```nushell
0x[7F000001] | chunks 1 | each { into int } | str join "."
# => 127.0.0.1
```

### `bytes split`

In [#14652](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/14652), [@Bahex](https://github.com/Bahex) added `bytes split`.
It is similar to `split row` and `lines`:

- Like `split row`, it splits its input over an arbitrary delimiter.
- Like `lines`, it is streaming.

Some programs can output text delimited by characters or sequences other than newlines ("\n"), commonly the NUL byte ("\0"), as the returned text may contain newlines.
If it is desirable to not collect the input or to act on a result as soon as possible `bytes split` can be used.

For example, reading events from a socket or pipe:

```nushell
open --raw ./events.sock | bytes split (char nul) | each { decode }
```

### Duration value output from `debug profile` [[toc](#table-of-contents)]

The `debug profile` command now has a `--duration-values` flag, which allows outputting the run time of an instruction with proper duration values rather than floats representing milliseconds. This allows for more fine-grained measurement, and lets you use commands which work on duration values [#14749](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/14749).

### Several `into` commands can now operate on their own type

Thanks to to | [@Tyarel8](https://github.com/Tyarel8) in [#14845](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/14845),  
[#14881](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/14881), and
[#14882](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/14882),
the `into datetime`, `into cell-path`, and `into glob` commands can now accept (respectively), a `datimetime`, `cell-path`, or `glob`.

The commands will now return the values unaltered in these cases.

### `source null`/`use null`

Thanks to [@Bahex](https://github.com/Bahex) in [#14773](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/14773), `source` and `use` can be used with `null`, in which case the command is a noop.
This allows _conditionally sourcing files_, if the condition is decidable at parse time.

```nushell
const file = path self local.nu
const file = if ($file | path exists) { $file } else { null }

source $file
```

### New config option: `banner: 'short'`

With [#14638](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/14638), users can now configuration Nushell to start with a "short" welcome banner.

The "short" banner will only show the startup time, allowing the user to populate the rest of the banner information as desired.

### `move --first`/`--list` flags

[@Coca162](https://github.com/Coca162) added `--first`/`--last` flags to the `move` command in [#14961](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/14961),
providing a convenient shorthand for moving a column to the first or last position in a table.

### `find --no-highlight` switch

With [#14970](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/14970),
[@Mudada](https://github.com/Mudada) added `--no-highlight` to the `find` command. This provides an easy way to remove ANSI formatting and
highlighting from non-regex `find`s and still keep the result as a table.

### `content_type` metadata is now assigned to known filetypes that don't have a `from` convertor

In ([#14670](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/14670)), [@NotTheDr01ds](https://github.com/NotTheDr01ds) changed the `open` command to assign `content_type` metadata when a `from` convertor isn't
available for a known filetype. This primarily allows `open file.nu` to provide `application/x-nuscript` as the `content-type` even when
not using `open --raw`.

## Breaking changes

| [@IanManske](https://github.com/IanManske) | Improve and fix filesize formatting/display | [#14397](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/14397) |
| [@NotTheDr01ds](https://github.com/NotTheDr01ds) | Rename `std/core` to `std/prelude` | [#14962](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/14962) |

### `ENV_CONVERSIONS` take effect immediately

Thanks to [@Bahex](https://github.com/Bahex) in [#14591](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/14591), when `$env.ENV_CONVERSIONS` is updated, changes take effect immediately.

Previously, to make use of `ENV_CONVERSIONS` in your `config.nu`, you would need to set it up in `env.nu`, as it would only take effect after the file it was modified in was read.
Now, you can set it in `config.nu` and immediately make use of its results.

This also makes it useful for use in scripts and other modules.

### External completers fall back to file completions only on `null` [[toc](#table-of-contents)]

With [#14781](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/14781), the external completer will fall back to file completions only if `null` is returned. The external completer used to do this for any invalid value, but completions will now be suppressed if a non-null invalid value is returned.

### Custom completions inherit `case_sensitive` option from config [[toc](#table-of-contents)]

With [#14738](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/14738), when matching suggestions from a custom completions, the case sensitivity setting is always inherited from `$env.config.completions.case_sensitive`. Previously, if a custom completer returned a record containing an `options` field but didn't specify the `case_sensitive` option, it would default to `true`.

This change doesn't apply to custom completers that return either lists or records without an `options` field. For such completers, `case_sensitive` was always inherited from `$env.config.completions.case_sensitive`.

### Command pipeline input/output type changes [[toc](#table-of-contents)]

As part of the introduction of [run-time pipeline input type-checking](#run-time-pipeline-input-typechecking-toc) ([#14741](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/14741), [#14922](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/14922)), we discovered some inaccuracies in the listed input types for each command. The following commands had their input/output types adjusted to be more accurate:

- `drop nth`
- `from csv`
- `from tsv`
- `get`
- `headers`
- `history import`
- `into string`
- `reject`
- `rotate`

Additionally, the following commands have temporarily been given an input type of `any` to prevent undesirable errors. Unfortunately, this prevents input type checking at both parse-time and run-time for these commands, despite being possible previously. This doesn't affect many commands, and is intended as a workaround until a more robust solution can be implemented. For more details, see [#14922](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/14922).

- `load-env`
- `nu-check`
- `open`
- `polars when`
- `stor insert`
- `stor update`
- `format date`
- `into datetime`

#### Removed `run-external` and `exec` required positional argument [[toc](#table-of-contents)]

With [#14765](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/14765), lists can now be spread directly into `run-external` and `exec`:

```nushell
let command = ["cat" "hello.txt"]
run-external ...$command
# => hello world!
```

#### Immediate error return [[toc](#table-of-contents)]

With [#14874](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/14874), if Nushell detects that an error value passed to a command as pipeline input or as an argument, it will immediately return that error rather than continuing execution. Nested errors (errors in lists, records, etc.) are unaffected.

#### N-dots tweak [[toc](#table-of-contents)]

With [#14755](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/14755), [n-dots](/book/moving_around.md#changing-the-current-directory) such as `...` are no longer expanded when prefixed with `./` (ex. `...` is expanded, `./...` is no longer expanded). This should make the feature less surprising, while also providing better compatibility with external programs using `...` as part of their CLI.

#### `config reset` fix [[toc](#table-of-contents)]

With the config changes in the previous release, some of the internal files were moved around, causing `config reset` to use the "default" config (e.g., `config nu --default`) rather than the "scaffold" or empty config which gets created when you start Nushell for the first time. With [#14756](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/14756), `config reset` now works as intended again.

#### Fix empty list display when using `print` [[toc](#table-of-contents)]

Previously, the `print` command would print the "empty list" placeholder text without a newline, causing messy looking output. This is fixed by [#14758](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/14758), [#14766](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/14766).

#### Internal changes to `PipelineData` spans [[toc](#table-of-contents)]

With [#14757](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/14757), spans will now be maintained in some places where they were previously overridden by command calls. Some errors should now point to the actual source of a value, rather than pointing to the command which used it.

#### Range related bug fixes

In [#14863](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/14863), [@Bahex](https://github.com/Bahex) fixed range related bugs in

- `str substring`
- `str index-of`
- `slice`
- `bytes at`

#### `std` enhancements

In [#14763](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/14763), [@Bahex](https://github.com/Bahex) made small, backwards compatible enhancements to `std`

- `iter find` and `iter find-index` work better with streams, only consuming the input up to the first matching item.
- Added `log set-level`, a small convenience command for changing the current logging level.
