# Changes

## Additions

### Custom completers fall back to file completions [[toc](#table-of-contents)]

With [#14781](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/14781), custom completers can return `null` to fall back to file completions.

## Breaking changes

### External completers fall back to file completions only on `null` [[toc](#table-of-contents)]

With [#14781](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/14781), the external completer will fall back to file completions only if `null` is returned. The external completer used to do this for any invalid value, but completions will now be suppressed if a non-null invalid value is returned.

### Custom completions inherit `case_sensitive` option from config [[toc](#table-of-contents)]

With [#14738](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/14738), when matching suggestions from a custom completions, the case sensitivity setting is always inherited from `$env.config.completions.case_sensitive`. Previously, if a custom completer returned a record containing an `options` field but didn't specify the `case_sensitive` option, it would default to `true`.

This change doesn't apply to custom completers that return either lists or records without an `options` field. For such completers, `case_sensitive` was always inherited from `$env.config.completions.case_sensitive`.

## Deprecations

## Removals

- `utouch` has been renamed to `touch` in [#14721](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/14721).
