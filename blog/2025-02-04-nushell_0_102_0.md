# Highlights and themes of this release [[toc](#table-of-contents)]

## Run-time pipeline input typechecking [[toc](#table-of-contents)]

::: warning Breaking change
See a full overview of the [breaking changes](#breaking-changes)
:::

Previously, the type of a command's pipeline input was only checked against the input/output types of that command at parse-time. With [#14741](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/14741), this check also now happens at run-time. While these kinds of errors can often be caught at parse-time, adding run-time checks ensures commands can't receive unexpected input values.

Here's an example command, which should only accept integer pipeline input:

```nu
def cool-int-print []: int -> nothing {
  print $"my cool int is ($in)"
}

1 | cool-int-print
# => my cool int is 1

"evil string" | cool-int-print
# => Error: nu::parser::input_type_mismatch
# =>
# =>   × Command does not support string input.
# =>    ╭─[entry #12:1:17]
# =>  1 │ "evil string" | cool-int-print
# =>    ·                 ───────┬──────
# =>    ·                        ╰── command doesn't support string input
# =>    ╰────
```

The parser sees a string, and rejects the invalid input. Before this release however, if the parser couldn't determine an input was invalid, it would happily pass along the invalid value. In this example, the output type of `from json` is `any`, so the parser doesn't know we're trying to pass a string to `cool-int-print`:

```nu
"evil string" | from json | cool-int-print
# => my cool int is evil string
```

After this release, Nushell will also enforce the allowed input types at run-time (notice the error starts with `nu::shell` rather than `nu::parse`):

```nu
"evil string" | from json | cool-int-print
# => Error: nu::shell::only_supports_this_input_type
# =>
# =>   × Input type not supported.
# =>    ╭─[entry #18:1:17]
# =>  1 │ "evil string" | from json | cool-int-print
# =>    ·                 ────┬────   ───────┬──────
# =>    ·                     │              ╰── only int input data is supported
# =>    ·                     ╰── input type: string
# =>    ╰────
```

Because of this change, you may notice some new errors in your scripts like the one above. We've already adjusted the input/output types of many commands to better match their actual behavior (see [Command pipeline input/output type changes](#command-pipeline-input-output-type-changes-toc)), but if you run into an unexpected input type checking error, don't hesitate to file an issue!

# Changes [[toc](#table-of-contents)]

## Additions [[toc](#table-of-contents)]

### New command: `version check` [[toc](#table-of-contents)]

Thanks to [@fdncred](https://github.com/fdncred) for the new `version check` command ([#14880](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/14880)) which can check your current Nushell version against the latest available release.

### `generate` with input [[toc](#table-of-contents)]

In [#14804](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/14804), [@Bahex](https://github.com/Bahex) added input support to `generate`. Without pipeline input, `generate` works same as before. But with pipeline input, `generate`'s closure argument is supplied two arguments:

- an item from the input
- the `next` value from the previous iteration

This allows `generate` to act as a stateful `each` and more, filling the niche of a stateful _and_ streaming filter command.

#### `std/iter scan`

Thanks to the new capabilities of `generate`, `iter scan` was updated to be streaming. It is also considerably more performant with large inputs.

### New operators: `has` and `not-has` [[toc](#table-of-contents)]

In [#14841](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/14841), [@Bahex](https://github.com/Bahex) added two new operators: `has` and `not-has`. They are analogous to `in` and `not-in`, with the order of operands switched. This makes certain operations more ergonomic.

```nu
[[name, children]; [foo, [a, b, c]], [bar [d, e, f]]] | where ("e" in $it.children)
# vs
[[name, children]; [foo, [a, b, c]], [bar [d, e, f]]] | where children has "e"
```

### User autoload directories [[toc](#table-of-contents)]

Previous Nushell releases added the `vendor/autoload` directories which were automatically sourced during startup. In [#14669](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/14669), [@NotTheDr01ds](https://github.com/NotTheDr01ds) extended this to include user directories.

During startup, any `.nu` files in `($nu.default-config-dir)/autoload` will be automatically sourced during startup. This occurs after any vendor files have been processed, allowing user override of vendor settings if needed.

### Custom completers fall back to file completions [[toc](#table-of-contents)]

With [#14781](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/14781), custom completers can return `null` to fall back to file completions.

### `get` is now const [[toc](#table-of-contents)]

With [#14751](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/14751), the `get` command can now be used during [constant evaluation](/book/how_nushell_code_gets_run.md#parse-time-constant-evaluation). For example:

```nu
const foo = [1 2 3] | get 2
$foo
# => 3
```

### `format number` (renamed from `fmt`) [[toc](#table-of-contents)]

The `fmt` command, which is used for converting numbers to a variety of different formats, has been renamed to `format number` in [#14875](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/14875).

### `chunks` supports binary input [[toc](#table-of-contents)]

Thanks to [@Bahex](https://github.com/Bahex) in [#14649](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/14649), `chunks` command now works on binary values and binary streams, making it easier to inspect and work on binary values and allowing partial reads from streams without collecting.

For example, while working with a binary file or protocol, you might need to convert an IP address stored as raw bytes to the more commonly used string format.

```nu
0x[7F000001] | chunks 1 | each { into int } | str join "."
# => 127.0.0.1
```

### New command: `bytes split` [[toc](#table-of-contents)]

In [#14652](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/14652), [@Bahex](https://github.com/Bahex) added `bytes split`. It is similar to `split row` and `lines`:

- Like `split row`, it splits its input over an arbitrary delimiter.
- Like `lines`, it is streaming.

Some programs can output text delimited by characters or sequences other than newlines ("\n"), commonly the NUL byte ("\0"), as the returned text may contain newlines. If it is desirable to not collect the input or to act on a result as soon as possible `bytes split` can be used.

For example, reading events from a socket or pipe:

```nu
open --raw ./events.sock | bytes split (char nul) | each { decode }
```

### New command: `help pipe-and-redirect` [[toc](#table-of-contents)]

Thanks [@WindSoilder](https://github.com/WindSoilder) for the new `help pipe-and-redirect command` which lists the pipe and redirect operators ([#14821](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/14821)).

### The `start` command now works with non-HTTP URIs [[toc](#table-of-contents)]

Thanks to [@anomius](https://github.com/anomius) for adding support for additional URI types to the `start` command in ([#14370](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/14370)). This will call a system-specific opener under the hood (`open` for macOS, `start` for Windows, and `xdg-open` or some other program for Linux).

This means that, for example, if you have Spotify installed and configured to open `spotify:` links, then the following will now start a Rickroll:

```nu
start spotify:track:4PTG3Z6ehGkBFwjybzWkR8?si=f9b4cdfc1aa14831
```

Of course, there are many more productive uses and URIs.

### Duration value output from `debug profile` [[toc](#table-of-contents)]

The `debug profile` command now has a `--duration-values` flag, which allows outputting the run time of an instruction with proper duration values rather than floats representing milliseconds. This allows for more fine-grained measurement, and lets you use commands which work on duration values [#14749](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/14749).

### Several `into` commands can now operate on their own type [[toc](#table-of-contents)]

Thanks to [@Tyarel8](https://github.com/Tyarel8) in [#14845](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/14845), [#14881](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/14881), and [#14882](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/14882), the `into datetime`, `into cell-path`, and `into glob` commands can now accept (respectively), a `datimetime`, `cell-path`, or `glob`. The commands will now return the values unaltered in these cases.

### `touch` now supports globbing [[toc](#table-of-contents)]

Thanks to [@hjetmundsen](https://github.com/hjetmundsen), the `utouch` (now `touch`) command supports globbing ([#14674](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/14674)).

### `source null`/`use null` [[toc](#table-of-contents)]

Thanks to [@Bahex](https://github.com/Bahex) in [#14773](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/14773), `source` and `use` can be used with `null`, in which case the command is a noop. This allows conditionally sourcing files, if the condition is decidable at parse time.

```nu
const file = path self local.nu
const file = if ($file | path exists) { $file } else { null }

source $file
```

### `run-external` and `exec` now support list spreading [[toc](#table-of-contents)]

With [#14765](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/14765), lists can now be spread directly into `run-external` and `exec`:

```nu
let command = ["cat" "hello.txt"]
run-external ...$command
# => hello world!
```

### New config option: `use_ansi_coloring: 'auto'` [[toc](#table-of-contents)]

[@cptpiepmatz](https://github.com/cptpiepmatz) `config.use_ansi_coloring: 'auto'` option in [#14647](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/14647). When set, Nushell will use ANSI coloring only when outputting to a terminal. This allows easier use of Nushell in embedded environments. When embedding Nushell in an environment that supports ANSI formatting, you can change the setting to `true`.

#### New command: `config use-colors`

The new `config use-colors` command will return the evaluated result of the `use_ansi_coloring` option. This allows scripts and custom commands to determine whether to add or strip ANSI formatting from their output ([#14683](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/14683)).

### New config option: `banner: 'short'` [[toc](#table-of-contents)]

With [#14638](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/14638), users can now configuration Nushell to start with a "short" welcome banner. The "short" banner will only show the startup time, allowing the user to populate the rest of the banner information as desired.

### `move --first`/`--list` flags [[toc](#table-of-contents)]

[@Coca162](https://github.com/Coca162) added `--first`/`--last` flags to the `move` command in [#14961](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/14961), providing a convenient shorthand for moving a column to the first or last position in a table.

### `find --no-highlight` switch [[toc](#table-of-contents)]

With [#14970](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/14970), [@Mudada](https://github.com/Mudada) added `--no-highlight` to the `find` command. This provides an easy way to remove ANSI formatting and highlighting from non-regex `find`s and still keep the result as a table.

### `seq date` enhancements [[toc](#table-of-contents)]

The `seq date` command can now use any duration for the `--increment` thanks to [@pyz4](https://github.com/pyz4)'s [#14903](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/14903).

### `content_type` metadata is now assigned to known filetypes that don't have a `from` convertor [[toc](#table-of-contents)]

In ([#14670](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/14670)), [@NotTheDr01ds](https://github.com/NotTheDr01ds) changed the `open` command to assign `content_type` metadata when a `from` convertor isn't available for a known filetype. This primarily allows `open file.nu` to provide `application/x-nuscript` as the `content-type` even when not using `open --raw`.

#### `content_type` set for `config nu` output

Similarly in [#14666](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/14666), [@cptpiepmatz](https://github.com/cptpiepmatz) updated the `config nu` command to add `content_type` metadata. These two changes allow users to create a disable hook which will automatically `nu-highlight` the results.

## Breaking changes [[toc](#table-of-contents)]

### `$env.config.filesize` changes [[toc](#table-of-contents)]

This release saw an overhaul to file size formatting and related config settings ([#14397](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/14397)). Previously, two separate config settings, `$env.config.filesize.format` and `$env.config.filesize.metric`, determined how file sizes were formatted. `format` determined the unit to use and `metric` determined whether to use metric or binary units. However, the two settings were allowed to conflict. E.g., `format` could be set to a binary unit, but `metric` could be set to `true`. To avoid this confusion, the file size unit is now controlled through a single option: `$env.config.filesize.unit`. It can be set to one of the following values:

- A metric unit: `kB`, `MB`, `GB`, `TB`, `PB`, or `EB` (case sensitive!).
- A binary unit: `KiB`, `MiB`, `GiB`, `TiB`, `PiB`, or `EiB` (case sensitive!).
- `metric`: automatically choose a metric unit of an appropriate scale. In the old config, this would be equivalent to `{ format: auto, metric: true }`.
- `binary`: automatically choose a binary unit of an appropriate scale. In the old config, this would be equivalent to `{ format: auto, metric: false }`.

```nu
# unit = kB
1kB  # => 1 kB
1KiB # => 1.024 kB

# unit = KiB
1kB  # => 0.9765625 KiB
1KiB # => 1 KiB

# unit = metric
1000B     # => 1 kB
1024B     # => 1.024 kB
10_000MB  # => 10 GB
10_240MiB # => 10.73741824 GB

# unit = binary
1000B     # => 1000 B
1024B     # => 1 KiB
10_000MB  # => 9.313225746154785 GiB
10_240MiB # => 10 GiB
```

In addition, you can now control how many decimal places file sizes should be formatted with using `$env.config.filesize.precision`. When set to `null`, as many decimal places as necessary will be printed. Otherwise, when set to a integer, that number of decimal places will be shown.

```nu
# precision = 1
1001B # => 1.0 kB

# precision = 0
1001B # => 1 kB

# precision = null
1001B # => 1.001 kB
1000B # => 1 kB
```

The default `$env.config.filesize` is `{ unit: metric, precision: 1 }`.

### `format filesize` [[toc](#table-of-contents)]

Related to changes above, `format filesize` is now case-sensitive for the file size unit to avoid ambiguity for `KB` ([#14397](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/14397)).

### `ENV_CONVERSIONS` take effect immediately [[toc](#table-of-contents)]

Thanks to [@Bahex](https://github.com/Bahex) in [#14591](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/14591), when `$env.ENV_CONVERSIONS` is updated, changes take effect immediately. Previously, to make use of `ENV_CONVERSIONS` in your `config.nu`, you would need to set it up in `env.nu`, as it would only take effect after the file it was modified in was read. Now, you can set it in `config.nu` and immediately make use of its results. This also makes it useful for use in scripts and other modules.

### External completers fall back to file completions only on `null` [[toc](#table-of-contents)]

With [#14781](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/14781), the external completer will fall back to file completions only if `null` is returned. The external completer used to do this for any invalid value, but completions will now be suppressed if a non-null invalid value is returned.

### Custom completions inherit `case_sensitive` option from config [[toc](#table-of-contents)]

With [#14738](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/14738), when matching suggestions from a custom completions, the case sensitivity setting is always inherited from `$env.config.completions.case_sensitive`. Previously, if a custom completer returned a record containing an `options` field but didn't specify the `case_sensitive` option, it would default to `true`.

This change doesn't apply to custom completers that return either lists or records without an `options` field. For such completers, `case_sensitive` was always inherited from `$env.config.completions.case_sensitive`.

### Command pipeline input/output type changes [[toc](#table-of-contents)]

As part of the introduction of [run-time pipeline input type-checking](#run-time-pipeline-input-typechecking-toc) ([#14741](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/14741), [#14922](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/14922)), we discovered some inaccuracies in the listed input types for each command. The following commands had their input/output types adjusted to be more accurate:

- `drop nth`
- `from csv`
- `from tsv`
- `get`
- `headers`
- `history import`
- `into string`
- `reject`
- `rotate`

Additionally, the following commands have temporarily been given an input type of `any` to prevent undesirable errors. Unfortunately, this prevents input type checking at both parse-time and run-time for these commands, despite being possible previously. This doesn't affect many commands, and is intended as a workaround until a more robust solution can be implemented. For more details, see [#14922](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/14922).

- `load-env`
- `nu-check`
- `open`
- `polars when`
- `stor insert`
- `stor update`
- `format date`
- `into datetime`

### N-dots tweak [[toc](#table-of-contents)]

With [#14755](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/14755), [n-dots](/book/moving_around.md#changing-the-current-directory) such as `...` are no longer expanded when prefixed with `./` (ex. `...` is expanded, `./...` is no longer expanded). This should make the feature less surprising, while also providing better compatibility with external programs using `...` as part of their CLI.

## Deprecations [[toc](#table-of-contents)]

The following commands have been deprecated in 0.102.0. They remain available, but will be removed in a future release. We recommend
updating existing code to use the replacement command.

### `into bits` [[toc](#table-of-contents)]

`into bits` is deprecated and replaced with the new `format bits` command with ([#14634](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/14634).

### `range` [[toc](#table-of-contents)]

`range` is deprecated and replaced with the new `slice` command with [#14825](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/14825).

### `fmt` [[toc](#table-of-contents)]

`fmt` is deprecated and replaced with the new `format number` command with [#14875](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/14875).

## Removals [[toc](#table-of-contents)]

### `utouch` [[toc](#table-of-contents)]

`utouch` is now the `touch` command in [#14721](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/14721).

### `split-by` [[toc](#table-of-contents)]

The `split-by` command was previously deprecated in 0.101 and have been removed in this release ([#14726](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/14726)).

### `date to-record` [[toc](#table-of-contents)]

The `date to-record` command was previously deprecated in 0.101 and have been removed in this release ([#14726](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/14726)).

### `date to-table` [[toc](#table-of-contents)]

The `date to-table` command was previously deprecated in 0.101 and have been removed in this release ([#14726](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/14726)).

## Bug fixes and other changes [[toc](#table-of-contents)]

### Immediate error return [[toc](#table-of-contents)]

With [#14874](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/14874), if Nushell detects that an error value passed to a command as pipeline input or as an argument, it will immediately return that error rather than continuing execution. Nested errors (errors in lists, records, etc.) are unaffected.

### `config reset` fix [[toc](#table-of-contents)]

With the config changes in the previous release, some of the internal files were moved around, causing `config reset` to use the "default" config (e.g., `config nu --default`) rather than the "scaffold" or empty config which gets created when you start Nushell for the first time. With [#14756](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/14756), `config reset` now works as intended again.

### Fix empty list display when using `print` [[toc](#table-of-contents)]

Previously, the `print` command would print the "empty list" placeholder text without a newline, causing messy looking output. This is fixed by [#14758](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/14758), [#14766](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/14766).

### Internal changes to `PipelineData` spans [[toc](#table-of-contents)]

With [#14757](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/14757), spans will now be maintained in some places where they were previously overridden by command calls. Some errors should now point to the actual source of a value, rather than pointing to the command which used it.

### Range related bug fixes [[toc](#table-of-contents)]

In [#14863](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/14863), [@Bahex](https://github.com/Bahex) fixed range related bugs in

- `str substring`
- `str index-of`
- `slice`
- `bytes at`

### `std` enhancements [[toc](#table-of-contents)]

In [#14763](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/14763), [@Bahex](https://github.com/Bahex) made small, backwards compatible enhancements to `std`

- `iter find` and `iter find-index` work better with streams, only consuming the input up to the first matching item.
- Added `log set-level`, a small convenience command for changing the current logging level.

### Nuon conversions of range values now keep step size [[toc](#table-of-contents)]

Previously, the step size of range values were discarded when converting `to nuon`.
With [#14687](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/14687), the `to nuon` conversion of `range` values now include the step size.
As a result, `to nuon`/`from nuon` round trips now work for these values. Thanks [@Bahex](https://github.com/Bahex)!

### `explore` command panic when viewing small binary files [[toc](#table-of-contents)]

[#14592](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/14592) fixes a panic in `explorer` when viewing small binary files
thanks to [@ChetanXpro](https://github.com/ChetanXpro).

### Convert Path to `list` in main and preserve case [[toc](#table-of-contents)]

With [#14764](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/14764), the system `PATH` is now converted to a list
before the configuration files are processed. An explicit `ENV_CONVERSIONS` is no longer required for the `PATH`.

It should be safe to remove any existing `ENV_CONVERSIONS` entry for `PATH`.

The case of the `PATH` is also now preserved during this conversion.

### Fix improperly escaped strings in `stor update` [[toc](#table-of-contents)]

[@NotTheDr01ds](https://github.com/NotTheDr01ds) fixed an issue in `stor update` which prevented
single quotes from being stored properly ([#14921](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/14921)).

### Fix: Auto `cd` should not canonicalize symbolic path [[toc](#table-of-contents)]

With [#14708](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/14708),
[@WindSoilder](https://github.com/WindSoilder) fixes an issue where using `..` to go up one
directory from a symlink would result in the wrong PWD.

### Fix: Pressing <kbd>Esc</kbd> or <kbd>Q</kbd> was not closing `explore` [[toc](#table-of-contents)]

Thanks to [@dam4rus](https://github.com/dam4rus), <kbd>Esc</kbd> and <kbd>Q</kbd> now properly close `explore` once again
([#14941](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/14941)).

### Custom values are now expanded in tables [[toc](#table-of-contents)]

Previously, custom values were being stringified in tables. [#14760](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/14760) expands these to display as Nushell values thanks to [@dead10ck](https://github.com/dead10ck).

### Change how `and` and `or` operations are compiled to IR to support custom values [[toc](#table-of-contents)]

[#14653](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/14653) allows the `and` and `or` operators to support custom values once again
thanks to [@devyn](https://github.com/devyn).

### Fix `stor reset` when there are foreign keys [[toc](#table-of-contents)]

Thanks to [@fdncred](https://github.com/fdncred) for fixing an issue where `stor reset` wasn't properly dropping tables
([#14772](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/14772)).

### New, improved `grid` icons [[toc](#table-of-contents)]

`grid --icons` now uses the icons from the `devicons` crate after
[#14827](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/14827).

### SHLVL decrement on `exec` [[toc](#table-of-contents)]

Thanks [@rikukiix](https://github.com/rikukiix) for fixing `exec` to properly decrement the `SHLVL` environment variable
([#14707](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/14707)).

### `cp` reflink support on FreeBSD [[toc](#table-of-contents)]

Thanks to [@sgvictorino](https://github.com/sgvictorino), `cp` no longer errors with "--reflink is only supported on
Linux and macOS" ([#14677](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/14677)).

### Fix root directory traversal issue [[toc](#table-of-contents)]

[@userwiths](https://github.com/userwiths) fixed an issue where `cd ..` at the root of a drive was returning the
incorrect directory ([#14747](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/14747)). Thank you!

### Fix `table` panic [[toc](#table-of-contents)]

[#14710](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/14710) fixes an issue where nested data was creating a panic when unexpanded
in a display hook. Thanks [@zhiburt](https://github.com/zhiburt)!

### Parser fixes [[toc](#table-of-contents)]

- Thanks [@WindSoilder](https://github.com/WindSoilder) for fixing an issue where a duration suffix in a variable name in a range confused the parser ([#14848](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/14848)).
- Thanks [@blindFS](https://github.com/blindFS) for multiple parser fixes (and even more LSP fixes!):
  - Fixes `$in`/`$it` having an unknown span ([#14789](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/14789)).
  - Fixed an issue where the span of `$it`/`$in` was set to the first character of its scope ([#14817](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/14817)).
  - Fixed a missing span of the entire block of a module file ([#14889](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/14889)).
  - Fixed an issue where the wrong span was highlighted when an `else` block had a parse error ([#14912](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/14912)).
  - Fixed the span of a keyword expression not including its subsidiary expression ([#14928](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/14928)).
- [@RobbingDaHood](https://github.com/RobbingDaHood) fixed multiple issues with parsed comments not being prefixed with a space or tab, or being the beginning of a token ([#14616](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/14616)). Thank you!

### Streaming improvements [[toc](#table-of-contents)]

- `du` now streams thanks to [@WindSoilder](https://github.com/WindSoilder)! ([#14665](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/14665))
- `get` and `reject` now support streaming thanks to [@cosineblast](https://github.com/cosineblast)! ([#14622](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/14622))
- `bytes at` now streams thanks to [@simon-curtis](https://github.com/simon-curtis) in [#13552](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/13552). Additionally, `skip` and `take` should now stream binary output when provided streaming binary input.
