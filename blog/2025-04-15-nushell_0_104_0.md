## A lot of improvement and bug fixes regarding datetime handling

Your local timezone is now accurately taken into account when parsing dates:
```nushell
~> "2025-01-01" | into datetime  # standard time (winter)
Wed, 1 Jan 2025 00:00:00 +0100 (3 months ago)
~> "2025-06-01" | into datetime  # daylight saving time (summer)
Sun, 1 Jun 2025 00:00:00 +0200 (in 2 months)
```

It is now possible to construct a datetime from a record input. If the timezone is not specified, the local is used.
```nushell
~> {year: 2025, month: 3, day: 30, hour: 12, minute: 15, second: 59, timezone: '+02:00'} | into datetime
Sun, 30 Mar 2025 12:15:59 +0200 (2 weeks ago)
```

Parsing a date as DMY is now possible using the `--format` option:
```nushell
~> "25/03/2024" | into datetime --format "%d/%m/%Y"
Mon, 25 Mar 2024 00:00:00 +0100 (a year ago)
```

```
Lastly, and this one is a breaking change, the human readable date parsing has been moved to a dedicated command.
```nushell
date from-human "next Friday at 6pm"
2025-04-18T18:00:00+02:00
```

# Full changelog

<!-- TODO:
    - `use nu_scripts/make_release/release-note/notes.nu *`
    - run `list-prs --milestone v0.104.0 | pr-table`
    - paste the output here

Afterwards, go through each PR and classify it as one of the following:
    - A user-facing change. These PRs should go into the `# Changes` section.
    - A plugin-facing change. These PRs should go in `# Notes for plugin developers`. Some plugin-facing changes might also be a user-facing change and vice versa.
    - A documentation improvement, error message improvement, refactoring PR, clippy fix, typo fix, etc. These PRs go into the `# Hall of fame`. You can just copy the table row in this section and paste it to the `# Hall of fame` section above. Note that major refactorings may warrant a section in `# Highlights`.
    - Dependabot PRs and version bumps should be ignored. They will only be mentioned in `# Full changelog`.
