# Nushell 0.95.0

Nushell, or Nu for short, is a new shell that takes a modern, structured approach to your command line. It works seamlessly with the data from your filesystem, operating system, and a growing number of file formats to make it easy to build powerful command line pipelines.

Today, we're releasing version 0.95.0 of Nu. This release adds external command parsing improvements, plugin version reporting, parse-time evaluation for many more string commands, constants for cache and data directories, and many bug fixes!

# Where to get it

Nu 0.95.0 is available as [pre-built binaries](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/releases/tag/0.95.0) or from [crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/nu). If you have Rust installed you can install it using `cargo install nu`.

As part of this release, we also publish a set of optional plugins you can install and use with Nu. To install, use `cargo install nu_plugin_<plugin name>`.

# Highlights and themes of this release [[toc](#table-of-content)]

## External command parsing improvements [[toc](#table-of-content)]

::: warning Breaking change
See a full overview of the [breaking changes](#breaking-changes)
:::

A lot of the quirks of external command parsing have been cleaned up in [#13089](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/13089), with most of the actual string handling work being moved into `nu-parser` itself. Previously, the parser was doing some very special things to create expressions in a way that `run-external` would then finish parsing in order to handle quotes in external options, globs, tilde expansion, etc., but this was error prone and did not have great test coverage.

Resolving this made it easier to find some of the edge cases that were not being handled, as well as making some syntax behave in a way that feels more consistent with the rest of Nushell:

- Bare word interpolation works for external command options, and otherwise embedded in other strings:

  ```nushell
  ^echo --foo=(2 + 2) # prints --foo=4
  ^echo -foo=$"(2 + 2)" # prints -foo=4
  ^echo foo="(2 + 2)" # prints (no interpolation!) foo=(2 + 2)
  ^echo foo,(2 + 2),bar # prints foo,4,bar
  ```

- Bare word interpolation expands for external command head/args:

  ```nushell
  let name = "exa"
  ~/.cargo/bin/($name) # this works, and expands the tilde
  ^$"~/.cargo/bin/($name)" # this doesn't expand the tilde
  ^echo ~/($name)/* # this glob is expanded
  ^echo $"~/($name)/*" # this isn't expanded
  ```

- Ndots are now supported for the head/args of an external command (`^.../foo` works, expanding to `^../../foo`)

  - Because our ndots handling requires path normalization, it is disabled for bare arguments that don't contain at least three consecutive dots, and for arguments that contain the string `://` as that is likely to be a URL.

- Glob values are now supported for head/args of an external command, and expanded appropriately:
  ```nushell
  ^("~/.cargo/bin/exa" | into glob) # the tilde is expanded
  ^echo ("*.txt" | into glob) # this glob is expanded
  ```

## Plugin version reporting [[toc](#table-of-content)]

::: warning Breaking change
See a full overview of the [breaking changes](#breaking-changes)
:::

Plugins can now report their own version to Nushell, and have it displayed in `plugin list` and `version`. This can help users understand exactly which plugin version they have active in their shell.

This is a breaking change for the Rust API, as implementing it on the `Plugin` trait is now required. We recommend the following implementation, which will take the plugin version directly from the cargo package metadata:

```rust
fn version(&self) -> String {
    env!("CARGO_PKG_VERSION").into()
}
```

If not using the Rust plugin API, you need to implement the new [`Metadata`](/contributor-book/plugin_protocol_reference.md#metadata-plugin-call) call. Providing a version is optional, but highly recommended.

## New `$nu.data-dir` and `$nu.cache-dir` Constants

To standardize the locations for user-level items such as completions, the constant `$nu.data-dir` has been introduced. The default value of `NU_LIB_DIRS` will now be:

```nushell
$env.NU_LIB_DIRS = [
    ($nu.default-config-dir | path join 'scripts') # add <nushell-config-dir>/scripts
    ($nu.data-dir | path join 'completions')       # default home for nushell completions
]
```

### Data Directory Locations

The location of the data directory will vary based on the operating system:

| Platform | Value                                                    | Example                                           |
| -------- | -------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| Linux    | `$XDG_DATA_HOME/nushell` or `$HOME/.local/share/nushell` | `/home/alice/.local/share/nushell`                |
| macOS    | `$HOME/Library/Application Support/nushell`              | `/home/alice/Library/Application Support/nushell` |
| Windows  | `{FOLDERID_RoamingAppData}\nushell`                      | `C:\Users\Alice\AppData\Roaming\nushell`          |

### Cache Directory Locations

Additionally, the constant `$nu.cache-dir` has been added for future use. The location of the cache directory will vary based on the operating system:

| Platform | Value                                               | Example                                |
| -------- | --------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Linux    | `$XDG_CACHE_HOME/nushell` or `$HOME/.cache/nushell` | `/home/alice/.cache/nushell`           |
| macOS    | `$HOME/Library/Caches/nushell`                      | `/home/alice/Library/Caches/nushell`   |
| Windows  | `{FOLDERID_LocalAppData}\nushell`                   | `C:\Users\Alice\AppData\Local\nushell` |

New constants for system-level items such as $nu.vendor-autoload-dir will be introduced in future releases.

## Additions [[toc](#table-of-content)]

## Breaking changes [[toc](#table-of-content)]

### `path type` [[toc](#table-of-content)]

After [#13007](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/13007), if the input path to `path type` is determined to not exist, `path type` will now return `null` instead of an empty string. In most cases, this should not require you to change your scripts. E.g., `("some/path" | path type) == dir` will still work as intended.

However, if the input path type was not able to be determined, `path type` will now create an error instead of silently returning an empty string. For example, invalid permissions for a path will now report an error:

```nushell
> '/root/test' | path type
Error: nu::shell::io_error

  × I/O error
   ╭─[entry #1:1:1]
 1 │ '/root/test' | path type
   · ──────┬─────
   ·       ╰── Permission denied (os error 13)
   ╰────
```

### `to toml` [[toc](#table-of-content)]

Thanks to [@KAAtheWiseGit](https://github.com/KAAtheWiseGit) in [#13018](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/13018), `to toml` will now output nushell date values as toml date values instead of as toml strings.

### `help commands` [[toc](#table-of-content)]

In the last release, changes were made to the `type` column for `scope commands` and `which`. However, the `command_type` column for `help commands` was missed, and this release makes its output/formatting consistent with the other two commands. In particular, `builtin` will now be reported as `built-in` ([#12996](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/12996)).

### `str contains --not` [[toc](#table-of-content)]

[#13124](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/13124) removes the `--not` flag on `str contains`. This flag was deprecated in the last release. You can check the [previous release notes](https://www.nushell.sh/blog/2024-05-28-nushell_0_94_0.html#str-contains-not-toc) for migration examples.

### `sys` [[toc](#table-of-content)]

Last release deprecated the `sys` command in favor of new subcommands. In this release, the deprecated output of `sys` has been removed, and `sys` will now only report the available subcommands ([#13114](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/13114)).

### `run-external` [[toc](#table-of-content)]

`run-external` now works more like any other command, without expecting a special call convention for its args:

```nushell
> run-external echo "'foo'"
# 0.94: foo
# 0.95: 'foo'
> run-external echo "*.txt"
# 0.94: (glob is expanded)
# 0.95: *.txt
```

This argument handling is now implemented in the parser instead. [See the previous section](#external-command-parsing-improvements-toc) for more information on these changes.

## Deprecations [[toc](#table-of-content)]

### `for --numbered` [[toc](#table-of-content)]

Thanks to [@NotTheDr01ds](https://github.com/NotTheDr01ds) in [#13112](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/13112), the obscure `--numbered` flag on `for` has been deprecated. Instead, please use the `enumerate` command.

```nushell
for x in ([bob fred] | enumerate) {
    print $'($x.index) is ($x.item)'
}
```

## Other changes [[toc](#table-of-content)]

### String command parse-time evaluation [[toc](#table-of-content)]

Thanks to [@Embers-of-the-Fire](https://github.com/Embers-of-the-Fire) in [#13032](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/13032), many more string-related commands can now be run during parse-time (i.e., used with `const`). This includes:

- `str trim`
- `str contains`
- `str distance`
- `str ends-with`
- `str expand`
- `str index-of`
- `str join`
- `str replace`
- `str reverse`
- `str starts-with`
- `str stats`
- `str substring`
- `str capitalize`
- `str downcase`
- `str upcase`
- `split chars`
- `split column`
- `split list`
- `split row`
- `split words`
- `format date`
- `format duration`
- `format filesize`
- `parse`
- `detect columns`
- `encode`
- `decode`

### Range slice changes [[toc](#table-of-content)]

In [#13113](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/13113), `str substring` and `bytes at` were changed so that they no longer error if the end range index is greater than the start range index. Instead, an empty string or binary value will be returned. For example, this can happen if the end index is negative:

```nushell
"aaa" | str substring 2..-3
```

### `from toml` [[toc](#table-of-content)]

Thanks to [@abusch](https://github.com/abusch) in [#13045](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/13045), `from toml` will now preserve the order of keys/entries as they appear in the input.

### `into filesize` [[toc](#table-of-content)]

- Thanks to [@hqsz](https://github.com/hqsz) in [#12974](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/12974), `into filesize` can now parse (more) strings that start with a plus sign.
- Thanks to [@hqsz](https://github.com/hqsz) in [#13110](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/13110), a bug due to integer casting was fixed for `into filesize`.

### `sys users` [[toc](#table-of-content)]

Thanks to [@weirdan](https://github.com/weirdan) in [#13172](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/13172), the signature of `sys users` has been fixed. It used to say that a record would be returned, but `sys users` actually returns a table.

### `explore` [[toc](#table-of-content)]

[#13074](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/13074) fixes a bug where `explore` would panic on an empty list.

## Notes for plugin developers [[toc](#table-of-content)]

### API [[toc](#table-of-content)]

- The `Plugin` trait now has a required method `fn version(&self) -> String`. The following implementation should suffice in most cases:
  ```rust
  fn version(&self) -> String {
      env!("CARGO_PKG_VERSION").into()
  }
  ```
- A new derive macro has been added ([#13031](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/13031)) for `FromValue` and `IntoValue` conversion traits to make serialization to and from Nushell values easier. The API design is similar to `serde-derive`. We expect this to make certain kinds of plugins much easier to develop! Many thanks to [@cptpiepmatz](https://github.com/cptpiepmatz).

### Protocol [[toc](#table-of-content)]

- The plugin protocol has a new required call, [`Metadata`](/contributor-book/plugin_protocol_reference.md#metadata-plugin-call), which is currently used to report version information on registration, but may be used for other plugin metadata in the future. The intention is that all fields are optional, and `version` is currently optional. This means that although the Rust API requires a version to be reported, it is perfectly allowed (but not recommended) for a plugin to not report a version.
