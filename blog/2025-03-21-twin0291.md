# This week in Nushell #291

Published Friday, March 21st, 2025

As you are well aware, 0.103 was released this week. You're probably too busy having fun with background jobs to read TWiN, but just in case ...

As is often the case in a release-week, many of this week's PRs were related to release activity. That doesn't mean there haven't been a few
nice additions since then:

- Thanks to @LoicRiegel for making some of the `math` commands a bit nicer. They used to complain when passed
  a range, but several additional `math` commands now play nice with ranges.
- Thanks to @fdncred for making `ps -l` more functional on macOS. You can now retrieve the user ID and more!
- @sholderbach and @132ikl made serialization even more consistent across various `to` commands. Thanks!

And since it's a relatively slow week in the repos, here are a few bonus links to some fun Discord discussions:

- RGBCube showed off some [cool code to linearize files in a directory](https://discord.com/channels/601130461678272522/615253963645911060/1350527148821315738) (with an updated version
  linked below).
- Cheer posted [a module to manage a text todo file!](https://discord.com/channels/601130461678272522/615253963645911060/1351058866800037969)
- blindfs24 linked an [absolutely ridonkulous Nushell config](https://discord.com/channels/601130461678272522/615253963645911060/1349919681103925338), leading to a [thread with additional configs](https://discord.com/channels/601130461678272522/1349919681103925338).
- fs posted some [cool calendar commands](https://discord.com/channels/601130461678272522/615253963645911060/1350653519132098632)
- Rose (a.k.a. 132ikl) and NotTheDr01ds collaborated on a [display hook to capture the output of any Nushell command](https://discord.com/channels/601130461678272522/615253963645911060/1350721741588135936)
  (see [this GitHub issue](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/issues/2731#issuecomment-2740322964) for the (almost) latest version). Almost latest because then ...
- Rose posted a method for [setting metadata from `metadata`](https://discord.com/channels/601130461678272522/615253963645911060/1352495741288972432) and then applied it to the last-output hook. (We'll try to get a versioned one up
  in Nu_scripts soon).
- NotTheDr01ds added [an example of how to run a command with a timeout](https://discord.com/channels/601130461678272522/601130461678272524/1351309481509916743) using the new background jobs feature.
