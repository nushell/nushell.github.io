# Highlights and themes of this release [[toc](#table-of-contents)]

## New Job-Control Features [[toc](#table-of-contents)]

### Inter-Job Messaging (Experimental) [[toc](#table-of-contents)]

Jobs can now communicate with other jobs. The following commands were added in
[#15253](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/15253):

- `job send`
- `job recv`
- `job flush`
- `job id`

See `help job <subcommand>` for details.

### Job tags [[toc](#table-of-contents)]

Jobs can now be tagged using `job tag`, added in [#15555](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/15555).

## New `datetime` and `duration` Features [[toc](#table-of-contents)]

Thanks to [@LoicRiegel](https://github.com/LoicRiegel) for a number of `datetime` and `duration` features in this release:

### New `date from-human` command [[toc](#table-of-contents)]

The new `date from-human` command introduced in [#15495](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/15495) is now used to parse human-language date forms like _"tomorrow"_ into `datetime` values.

```nushell
date from-human "next Friday at 6pm"
# => 2025-04-18T18:00:00+02:00
```

The equivalent functionality from `into datetime` has been removed from that command.

:::

### `into datetime` now accepts a record [[toc](#table-of-contents)]

With [#15455](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/15455), it is now possible to construct a datetime from a record input. If the timezone is not specified, the locale is used:

```nushell
{ year: 2025, month: 3, day: 30, hour: 12, minute: 15, second: 59, timezone: '+02:00' } | into datetime
# => Sun, 30 Mar 2025 12:15:59 +0200 (2 weeks ago)
```

### `into duration` now accepts a record [[toc](#table-of-contents)]

With [#15600](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/15600), it is now possible to construct a datetime from a record input. If the timezone is not specified, the local is used:

```nushell
{ week: 10, day: 1, hour: 2, minute: 3, second: 4, millisecond: 5, microsecond: 6, nanosecond: 7, sign: '-' } | into duration
# => -10wk 1day 2hr 3min 4sec 5ms 6µs 7ns
```

### `into datetime --format` can now parse dates and times separately [[toc](#table-of-contents)]

Previously, `into datetime --format` required both a date and a time. With [#15544](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/15544),
each can be created separately. The system's local timezone will be used
by default.

For example, to parse a `DD/MM/YYYY`:

```nushell
"25/03/2024" | into datetime --format "%d/%m/%Y"
# => Mon, 25 Mar 2024 00:00:00 +0100 (a year ago)
```

### `into duration` now accepts floats [[toc](#table-of-contents)]

With [#15297](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/15297), `into duration` now accepts floats as a valid input type:

```nushell
1.5day | into duration
# => 1day 12hr
```

## New Polars commands [[toc](#table-of-contents)]

The following `polars` commands have been added in this release:

- `polars join_where` ([#15635](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/15635) by [@MMesch](https://github.com/MMesch))
- `polars cut` and `polars qcut` for binning ([#15431](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/15431) by [@ayax79](https://github.com/ayax79))
- `polars into-schema` ([#15534](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/15534)) by [@ayax79](https://github.com/ayax79))
- `polars dtype` ([#15529](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/15529) by [@ayax79](https://github.com/ayax79), which also adds the `NuDataType` custom type)
- `polars replace-time-zone` ([#15538](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/15538) by [@pyz4](https://github.com/pyz4))
- `polars convert-time-zone` ([#15550](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/15550) by [@pyz4](https://github.com/pyz4))
- `polars over` ([#15551](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/15551) by [@pyz4](https://github.com/pyz4))
- `polars truncate` ([#15582](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/15582) by [@pyz4](https://github.com/pyz4))

# Changes [[toc](#table-of-contents)]

## Additions [[toc](#table-of-contents)]

### `kill` now accepts list spreading [[toc](#table-of-contents)]

In [#15558](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/15558) from [@Mrfiregem](https://github.com/Mrfiregem), the signature of the `kill` command was changed so that it can accept multiple arguments via the list spreading operator. For example:

```nushell
ps | where name == bash | kill ...$in.pid
```

### Custom indicator for missing table values [[toc](#table-of-contents)]

Missing values (not `null`) are represented by ❎ in tables. [#15647](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/15647) from [@Bahex](https://github.com/Bahex) makes this indicator configurable. For example:

```nushell
$env.config.table.missing_value_symbol = " ∅ "
```

### Some `math` commands now work with bounded ranges [[toc](#table-of-contents)]

With [#15319](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/15319) from [@LoicRiegel](https://github.com/LoicRiegel), the following commands have been updated to allow bounded ranges as input:

- `math abs`
- `math ceil`
- `math floor`
- `math log`
- `math round`

When passed a `range` input, the command is applied to each item of the range, thus producing a `list` of numbers as output.

Example:

```nushell
-2.2..2.5 | math floor
# => ╭───┬────╮
# => │ 0 │ -3 │
# => │ 1 │ -2 │
# => │ 2 │ -1 │
# => │ 3 │  0 │
# => │ 4 │  1 │
# => ╰───┴────╯
```

### The executable directory is now added to `$NU_PLUGIN_DIRS` by default [[toc](#table-of-contents)]

Many distributions (including our binary distributions) place plugins in the same directory as the Nushell executable. With [#15380](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/15380) from [@NotTheDr01ds](https://github.com/NotTheDr01ds), plugins in this type of environment will now work out-of-the-box using `plugin add`.

### `env-conversions` helpers added to the standard library [[toc](#table-of-contents)]

Previously, the default `$env.ENV_CONVERSION` for `PATH` could be "reused" in other path-related conversions. In a previous release, this conversion was removed and became Rust-based. [#15569](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/15569) by [@NotTheDr01ds](https://github.com/NotTheDr01ds) adds the equivalent helper to the standard library so that it can be easily used.

### Proxy support for `http` commands [[toc](#table-of-contents)]

With [#15597](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/15597) from [@scarlet-storm](https://github.com/scarlet-storm), commands like `http get` can now utilize a proxy using environment variables.

### Tab completion when importing the standard library and its exports [[toc](#table-of-contents)]

With [#15270](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/15270), [@blindFS](https://github.com/blindFS) enabled tab-completion for the standard library and its exports with the `use` (and related) commands.

### New columns available from `ps -l` on macOS [[toc](#table-of-contents)]

[#15341](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/15341) from [@fdncred](https://github.com/fdncred) adds the following columns to `ps -l` on macOS:

- `user_id`
- `priority`
- `process_threads`

### LSP: Snippet-style completions [[toc](#table-of-contents)]

In [#15494](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/15494), [@blindFS](https://github.com/blindFS) added the ability for completions of built-in commands to insert a snippet with placeholders for its arguments.

In addition, you'll find numerous LSP fixes below from [@blindFS](https://github.com/blindFS).

### `debug --raw-value` [[toc](#table-of-contents)]

[@fdncred](https://github.com/fdncred) added a `--raw-value` option to the `debug` command in [15581](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/15581) to allow retrieval of only the debug string part of the Nushell value.

### More info from `describe --detailed` [[toc](#table-of-contents)]

In [#15591](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/15591), [@fdncred](https://github.com/fdncred) added more details to the `describe --detailed` output, including the Rust data type, the Nushell data type, and the value.

### Support `PATHEXT` for additional extensions on Windows [[toc](#table-of-contents)]

With the changes in [#15611](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/15611) by [@hfrentzel](https://github.com/hfrentzel), Nushell will now automatically attempt to execute scripts using any extension found in the `PATHEXT` environment variable on Windows.

### Execute Nushell scripts on the Path in Windows [[toc](#table-of-contents)]

Also, with [#15486](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/15486) from [@mztikk](https://github.com/mztikk), Nushell scripts can be more easily executed from any directory in the `Path`.

### New flag `glob --follow-symlinks` [[toc](#table-of-contents)]

[@sebasnallar](https://github.com/sebasnallar) added `--follow-symlinks` to ... follow symlinks when globbing ([#15626](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/15626))

### Substring match algorithm [[toc](#table-of-contents)]

In [#15511](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/15511), [@vansh284](https://github.com/vansh284) added the option to use substring matching for completions. Previously, only prefix and fuzzy matching were allowed. Users can now set `$env.config.completions.algorithm` to `"substring"` to enable this.

Custom completers already had the ability to use substring matching by setting `positional: false` in their [options](https://www.nushell.sh/book/custom_completions.html#options-for-custom-completions). However, `positional` has now been deprecated, and completers should set `completion_algorithm: "substring"` to maintain the same behavior.

## Breaking changes [[toc](#table-of-contents)]

### Parse human date time explicitly [[toc](#table-of-contents)]

`into datetime` used to parse not only strictly formatted date time strings, but also human readable ones. This created some situations where unexpected values might result from `into datetime`. This functionality has been removed.

Instead, users can now explicitly choose to opt-in to that functionality using the new `date from-human` command added in [#15495](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/15495) by [@LoicRiegel](https://github.com/LoicRiegel).

### `str join` formatting for `datetime` values has changed [[toc](#table-of-contents)]

When a `datetime` is passed to `str join`, the resulting format of the string has changed. With [#15629](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/15629) from [@LoicRiegel](https://github.com/LoicRiegel), it will now format positive dates using RFC2822 and negative dates using RFC3339.

This could be a breaking change if you depend on a particular format of the output of `str join`. Consider using `format date` before `str join`.

### `history` with sqlite uses datetimes now [[toc](#table-of-contents)]

Previously, the `history` command would return a `start_timestamp` with a `string` when using the SQLite backend. With
[#15630](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/15630), it now returns an actual Nushell `datetime`.

If you were previously relying on a `string` value from that column, you can easily convert it using `format date`.

### `date` is now `datetime` [[toc](#table-of-contents)]

The `describe` command previously incorrectly reported `datetime` values as `date`. This has been fixed in [#15264](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/15264).

If you were previously checking the type of a value using `describe`, you should change occurrences of `date` to `datetime`.

## Deprecations [[toc](#table-of-contents)]

### `positional` completer option [[toc](#table-of-contents)]

The `positional` [option](https://www.nushell.sh/book/custom_completions.html#options-for-custom-completions) available to custom completers has been deprecated. See the section about the [Substring match algorithm](#substring-match-algorithm-toc) above for details.

## Removals [[toc](#table-of-contents)]

### Removed `-s` and `-p` in `do` [[toc](#table-of-contents)]

We deprecated the `-s` and `-p` flags and planned to remove them in version 0.102.0. We forgot about it for a couple of releases, but [#15456](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/15456) by [WindSoilder](https://github.com/WindSoilder) finally completes this removal.

# Notes for plugin developers [[toc](#table-of-contents)]

## Convert `IoError` into `LabeledError` [[toc](#table-of-contents)]

In version 0.102.0 `IoError`s were added on top of `std::io::Error`s. [@132ikl](https://github.com/132ikl) made it easier in [#15327](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/15327) to return these in `SimplePluginCommand`s.

## New Repo for Plugin Examples [[toc](#table-of-contents)]

[@cptpiepmatz](https://github.com/cptpiepmatz) has created a [new repository](https://github.com/nushell/plugin-examples) for plugin examples. It includes various examples demonstrating how to write plugins with different features and in multiple languages, including Nu. The existing plugin examples in the main repository will be moved there soon.

# Hall of fame [[toc](#table-of-contents)]

Thanks to all the contributors below for helping us solve issues, improve documentation, refactor code, and more! :pray:
