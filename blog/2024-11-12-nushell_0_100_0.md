# Nushell 0.100.0

Nushell, or Nu for short, is a new shell that takes a modern, structured approach to your command line. It works seamlessly with the data from your filesystem, operating system, and a growing number of file formats to make it easy to build powerful command line pipelines.

<!-- TODO: write this excerpt -->

Today, we're releasing version 0.100.0 of Nu. This release adds...

# Where to get it

Nu 0.100.0 is available as [pre-built binaries](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/releases/tag/0.100.0) or from [crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/nu). If you have Rust installed you can install it using `cargo install nu`.

As part of this release, we also publish a set of optional plugins you can install and use with Nu. To install, use `cargo install nu_plugin_<plugin name>`.

# Changes [[toc](#table-of-content)]

## Additions [[toc](#table-of-content)]

### `like` and `not-like` operators

With [#14072](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/14072), this release adds two "new" operators: `like` and `not-like`. These operators are alternative forms of the preexisting `=~` and `!~` operators, respectively. The only reason to use one form over the other is preference. For example, people familiar with SQL may prefer using `like` and `not-like`. In the future, there is a chance that the shorter forms may be removed, but there are no plans to do so yet, if at all.

### `catch` error record

In [#14082](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/14082), two additional columns were added to the error record passed to catch blocks/closures:

- `json`: a string containing the error data as JSON.
- `rendered`: a string containing the pretty formatted error message, roughly the same as you would see in your terminal.

### `help commands` and `scope commands`

The `help commands` and `scope commands` now output an `is_const` column indicating whether a command can be used in a parse-time constant context ([#14125](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/14125)).

### `ps -l`

On macOS, `ps -l` now lists the `start_time` of the processes. Windows and Linux already listed a `start_time` column ([#14127](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/14127)).

### `url build-query`

Thanks to [@adaschma](https://github.com/adaschma) in [#14073](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/14073), `url build-query` now allows list values in the parameter record. For example:

```nu
{ a: [1 2], b: 3 } | url build-query
# a=1&a=2&b=3
```

### `stor`

`stor` now supports list and table inputs thanks to [@friaes](https://github.com/friaes) in [#14175](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/14175).

### `to text --no-newline`

In [#14158](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/14158), the `--no-newline`/`-n` flag was added to `to text`. Providing this flag disables the trailing new line added to the output.

```nu
[a] | to text    # "a\n"
[a] | to text -n # "a"

[a b] | to text    # "a\nb\n"
[a b] | to text -n # "a\nb"
```

### `open --raw`

After [#14141](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/14141), `open --raw` now sets the `content-type` in the pipeline metadata for `nu`, `nuon`, and `json` files.

### `help`

The `help` output for commands now shows the command type in parenthesis after the command name (i.e., `plugin`, `alias`, or `custom`). Currently, the command type is not displayed for `built-in`, `keyword`, or known `external` commands ([#14165](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/14165)).

## Breaking changes [[toc](#table-of-content)]

### Lone, leading pipe in closures

Currently, a leading pipe character is allowed for pipelines in Nushell:

```nu
| ls
```

The closure syntax also uses pipe characters, so the parser previously allowed some cursed code:

```nu
{ |a $a }
{ |a, b $a $b }
```

Thanks to [@sgvictorino](https://github.com/sgvictorino) in [#14095](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/14095), unmatched leading pipe characters in closures are no longer allowed to prevent this potential ambiguity.

```nu
{ |a| $a } # ok
{ |a $a }  # now errors
```

### `plugin list` [[toc](#table-of-content)]

The `plugin list` command has been changed in [#14085](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/14085) to consider both the plugins currently present in the engine state as well as the plugins stored in the registry file. Changes made by `plugin add` and `plugin rm` should now be more obvious.

As part of this change, the `is_running` column has been replaced by a `status` column, which now displays many possible states a plugin can be in:

- `added`: The plugin is present in the plugin registry file, but not in the engine.
- `loaded`: The plugin is present both in the plugin registry file and in the engine, but is not running.
- `running`: The plugin is currently running, and the `pid` column should contain its process ID.
- `modified`: The plugin state present in the plugin registry file is different from the state in the engine.
- `removed`: The plugin is still loaded in the engine, but is not present in the plugin registry file.
- `invalid`: The data in the plugin registry file couldn't be deserialized, and the plugin most likely needs to be added again.

`running` always has high priority as a state, so other statuses won't be visible if a plugin is currently running. This means that

```nushell
# 0.99.0
plugin list | where is_running
```

can now always be replaced by:

```nushell
# 0.100.0
plugin list | where status == running
```

In case you want to avoid loading the plugin registry file (e.g. for performance reasons), you can now use the `--engine` flag to do so. Similarly, the `--registry` flag will only display the contents of the registry, without comparing them against the state of the engine (but all plugins will appear as `added`). The `--plugin-config` flag is now supported to allow use of a separate plugin registry file, identically to the other `plugin` commands.

## Deprecations [[toc](#table-of-content)]

## Removals [[toc](#table-of-content)]

## Bug fixes and other changes [[toc](#table-of-content)]

### `return`

In [#14120](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/14120), a bug was fixed were `return`, `break`, and `continue` would set the last exit code to 1.

### `to text`

`to text` would previously have different behavior for list values and streaming list input. This has been fixed with [#14158](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/14158), and the behavior for list streams is now used for list values.

### `use`

When importing a module that defines no constants, an empty record variable is no longer created ([#14051](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/14051)).

### `transpose`

With [#14096](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/14096), `transpose` now bubbles up any top-level errors it encounters in its input thanks to [@PhotonBursted](https://github.com/PhotonBursted).

### Constants with type signatures

Thanks to [@sgvictorino](https://github.com/sgvictorino) in [#14118](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/14118), a compiler bug preventing imports of constants with type signatures has been fixed.

### Short flag type checking

Short flags for commands were previously not being typed checked. This has been fixed in [#14074](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/14074) thanks to [@sgvictorino](https://github.com/sgvictorino).

### `in $range`

The step value for ranges was previously not taken into account when checking if a value was `in` a range. Thanks to [@JoaquinTrinanes](https://github.com/JoaquinTrinanes), this has been fixed with [#14011](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/14011).

### `clear`

On some terminals, `clear` would behave weirdly if used in a series of commands. Thanks to [@NotTheDr01ds](https://github.com/NotTheDr01ds), this has been fixed in [#14181](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/14181).

### Panic fixes

A parser panic regarding redirections was fixed in [#14035](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/14035) thanks to [@Kither12](https://github.com/Kither12).
