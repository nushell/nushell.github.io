# Nushell 0.99.1

Nushell, or Nu for short, is a new shell that takes a modern, structured approach to your command line. It works seamlessly with the data from your filesystem, operating system, and a growing number of file formats to make it easy to build powerful command line pipelines.

Today, we're releasing version 0.99.1 of Nu. This release fixes a bug regarding `$env.LAST_EXIT_CODE`.

# Where to get it

Nu 0.99.1 is available as [pre-built binaries](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/releases/tag/0.99.1) or from [crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/nu). If you have Rust installed you can install it using `cargo install nu`.

As part of this release, we also publish a set of optional plugins you can install and use with Nu. To install, use `cargo install nu_plugin_<plugin name>`.

# Bug fixes and other changes [[toc](#table-of-content)]

A bug was introduced in 0.99.0 where `return`, `break`, and `continue` could cause `$env.LAST_EXIT_CODE` to be set to 1. This has been fixed in [#14120](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/14120).
