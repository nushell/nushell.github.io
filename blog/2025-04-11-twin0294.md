# This week in Nushell #294

Published Friday, 2025-04-11

## Highlights

- @LoicRiegel continues to improve datetime commands with both some fixes as well as new features. Thanks to this
  work, a datetime can now be constructed (and round-tripped) from a record.

- _And_ also thanks to @LoicRiegel we have a new command in the mix as well - `date from-human` now replaces the former ability
  of `into datetime` to parse human-language date "descriptions" such as "tomorrow" and, err, "overmorrow"?

- Another week, and yet more new Polars commands - Thanks @pyz4 for `polars replace-time-zone`! And @ayax79 for `polars into-schema`

- Cool! @Kissaki added a new BSON plugin in the awesome_nu repo! Thank you!

- And thanks to 0x4D5352 for a new AeroSpace completion in nu_scripts!

- In a rare update to `nufmt`, @AucaCoyan added a warning to the README. Wait - how dare you? Oh, okay, that's a good call. Thank you!

- Attention all time travelers, if you brought an exabyte drive with you from the future, Nushell will now parse `df` exabyte
  values correctly. Also, please be kind enough to share a few of the upcoming (for the rest of us who are still temporally-challenged) football scores while you are here.
  This will help support Nushell development.
