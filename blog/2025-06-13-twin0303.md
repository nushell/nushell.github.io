# This week in Nushell #303

## Belatedly published Wednesday, July 9th for PRs the week ending 2025-06-13

This week, @noahfraiture made the `http get` and `http post` commands smarter. Just using `http` will usually choose the right verb!

Also `clip copy` and `clip paste` are moving! You'll now find them in `std`, rather than `std-rfc`.

Thanks for all the great contributions this week!
