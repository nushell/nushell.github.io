# This Week in Nushell #330

Published Friday, 2025-12-19, including PRs merged Friday, 2025-12-12 through Thursday, 2025-12-18.

## Highlights

This week brings a shiny new `explore config` command, some improved `explore regex` and `explore` UI, and HTTP pooling (amazing that our little shell does _this_!).

Also, MCP is included in all builds by default going forward! And hints can be user-disabled without resorting to hacky theme changes!
