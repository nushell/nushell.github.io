# Nushell 0.105.1

Today, we're releasing version 0.105.1 of Nu. This release adds a fix to make `cargo install nu` possible again.

# Where to get it

Nu 0.105.1 is available as [pre-built binaries](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/releases/tag/0.105.1) or from [crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/nu). If you have Rust installed you can install it using `cargo install nu`.

As part of this release, we also publish a set of optional [plugins](https://www.nushell.sh/book/plugins.html) you can install and use with Nushell.

## Reverted `coreutils` to fix `cargo install` [[toc](#table-of-contents)]

Bumping `coreutils` to 0.1.0 broke `cargo install nu`.
The new version requires the `PROJECT_NAME_FOR_VERSION_STRING` environment variable at build time, which we had set in our `.cargo/config.toml`.

Unfortunately, `cargo publish` does **not** ignore that file, which is considered [a bug in Cargo](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/issues/14001).
As a result, we published a version that couldn't be installed without setting that env var manually.

[The `coreutils` team is running into this too](https://github.com/uutils/coreutils/issues/7992).

For now, we've reverted [#15896](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/15896) in [#15932](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/15932).
We'll bump `coreutils` again once theyâ€™ve sorted out a fix.
