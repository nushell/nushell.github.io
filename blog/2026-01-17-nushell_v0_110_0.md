# Changes

## Breaking changes

### Renamed `$nu.temp-path` and `$nu.home-path`

For consistency with other `$nu` fields:
- `$nu.temp-path` has been renamed to `$nu.temp-dir`
- `$nu.home-path` has been renamed to `$nu.home-dir`

Implemented in [#17129](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/17129).

### Use `labels` for multiple labels in `error make`

Previously, when calling `error make` with a record argument, the `label` field could be either a single label or a list of labels. Now, it must be a single label. There is a new `labels` field that can hold a list of labels. Updated in [#17070](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/17070).

```nu
> def f [x y z] {
  error make {msg: here labels: [
    {text: "there" span: (metadata $x).span}
    {text: "everywhere" span: (metadata $y).span}
    {text: "somewhere" span: (metadata $z).span}
  ]
  }
}
f abcd [x y z] {d: a}

Error: nu::shell::error

  × here
   ╭─[entry #11:9:3]
 8 │ }
 9 │ f abcd [x y z] {d: a}
   ·   ──┬─ ───┬─── ───┬──
   ·     │     │       ╰── somewhere
   ·     │     ╰── everywhere
   ·     ╰── there
   ╰────
```

### IDE menu `min_description_width` should be non-zero

With [reedline#996](https://github.com/nushell/reedline/pull/996), the `min_description_width` setting for the IDE menu is used to determine when to switch the description to the left if `description_mode` is `prefer_right`. This means that if `min_description_width` is set to 0, the description box will always stay on the right, even when there isn't enough space to show it.

To fix this, set `min_description_width` to a width at which the description box can still hold a decent amount of text (e.g., 15, the new default).

### `to md` formats lists as unordered Markdown lists

`to md` will now format lists as unordered Markdown lists by default. For more information, see [TODO do this after TOC is generated!].
TODO fix link

## Additions

### New Configuration Option: `$env.config.show_hints`

You can now disable hints for completions and the history by setting `$env.config.show_hints = false`.

### Add `short` error_style

[#17097](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/17097) adds a new `short` option to `$env.config.error_style` for displaying errors as concise, single-line messages similar to classic shells.

```
$ ll
Error: External command failed: Command `ll` not found (Did you mean `all`?)
```

### New `error_style = true` setting

[#17105](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/17105) adds a new `tree` option for `$env.config.error_style` to show related/nested errors.

### New `error_lines` setting

[#17105](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/17105) adds a new `$env.config.error_lines` option to control the number of lines printed for error context. By default, this is set to 1.

### `let` can be used in pipelines

With [#17247](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/17247), the `let` command is now allowed to be at the end of the pipeline when a variable name is also provided.

```nu
ls | get name | let files
# Equivalent to the following:
let files = ls | get name
```

### New command: `unlet`

The new command `unlet`, introduced in [#17270](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/17270), will delete variables from memory.

```nu
❯ let a = 1;let b = 2;let c = 3;let d = 4
❯ $"($a)($b)($c)($d)"
1234
❯ unlet $a $b $cM
❯ $"($a)($b)($c)($d)"
Error: nu::shell::variable_not_found

  × Variable not found
   ╭─[entry #21:1:4]
 1 │ $"($a)($b)($c)($d)"
   ·    ─┬
   ·     ╰── variable not found
   ╰────
```

### Added record conversion to `into list`

With [#17127](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/17127), `into list` from `std-rfc/conversions` now handles record types.

```
use std-rfc/conversions *
{ a: 3, b: 7, c: 10 } | into list
# => ╭───┬─────┬───────╮
# => │ # │ key │ value │
# => ├───┼─────┼───────┤
# => │ 0 │ a   │     3 │
# => │ 1 │ b   │     7 │
# => │ 2 │ c   │    10 │
# => ╰───┴─────┴───────╯
```

### Polars plugin supports more cloud providers

#### Azure support

[#17116](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/17116) brings Azure blob storage support to the Polars plugin. The following environment variables are now supported:
- `AZURE_STORAGE_ACCOUNT_NAME`: storage account name
- `AZURE_STORAGE_ACCOUNT_KEY`: storage account master key
- `AZURE_STORAGE_ACCESS_KEY`: alias for `AZURE_STORAGE_ACCOUNT_KEY`
- `AZURE_STORAGE_CLIENT_ID`: client id for service principal authorization
- `AZURE_STORAGE_CLIENT_SECRET`: client secret for service principal authorization
- `AZURE_STORAGE_TENANT_ID`: tenant id used in oauth flows

Example Usage:
```nu
$env.AZURE_STORAGE_ACCOUNT_KEY = "<your access key value>"
$env.AZURE_STORAGE_ACCOUNT_NAME = "<your account name>"
ps | polars into-df | polars save azure://<your account name>/ps.parquet
polars open azure://<your account name>/ps.parquet | polars first 5 | polars collect
```

#### Google Cloud support

[#17135](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/17135) brings Google Cloud Storage support to the Polars plugin.

```nu
$env.GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT = "/path/to/service_account.json"
$env.GOOGLE_BUCKET = "your_bucket"
ps | polars into-df | polars save gs://nushell_testing/ps.parquet
polars open gs://nushell_testing/ps.parquet | polars first 5 | polars collect
```

### Include MCP server support by default

The MCP server support is now included as a default feature in [#17151](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/17151).

### Connection pool for `http` commands

With [#17157](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/17157) `http` subcommands now have a `--pool` flag for reusing connections:

```nu
http get https://www.google.com --pool
```

The `http pool` command can be used to reset and customize the HTTP connection pool.

### New `--output` flag for `timeit`

[#17202](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/17202) adds a flag called `--output` to the `timeit` command that will make the command return a record with both the execution time and the output of the closure.

```
> timeit --output { 'example text' }
╭────────┬──────────────╮
│ time   │ 14328        │
│ output │ example text │
╰────────┴──────────────╯
```

### Allow disabling filtering in custom completions

[#17253](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/17253) allows disabling filtering in custom completions. This is useful if you have a completer that filters on something other than the `value` of the suggestion (e.g. a completer that displays git commits and filters based on commit description).

::: note
If you disable filtering, your completions will also not be sorted.
:::

### New plugin interface `get_block_ir`

[#17279](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/17279) a new engine call to the plugin protocol for getting the compiled Intermediate Representation (IR) for a block:

```rust
fn get_block_ir(&self, block_id: BlockId) -> Result<IrBlock, ShellError>
```

### New `--list` flag to control list formatting in `to md`

With [#17250](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/17250), `to md` will format lists as unordered Markdown lists by default. The `--list` flag can be used to control this:

```nu
  [a b c] | to md                   # => "* a\n* b\n* c"
  [a b c] | to md --list unordered  # => "* a\n* b\n* c"
  [a b c] | to md --list ordered    # => "1. a\n2. b\n3. c"
  [a b c] | to md --list none       # => "a\nb\nc"
```

::: warning
**Breaking change**: The previous behavior was equivalent to `--list none` (no formatting for lists). The new behavior is `--list unordered`.
:::

### Add `--icons` option to table for `ls` tables

Similar to `ls | grid -i`, now `ls | table --icons` will display file icons to the left of the filename. This can be used in your `$env.config.hooks.display_output` to always display icons when using `ls`. Implemented in [#17248](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/17248).

![table --icons screenshot](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3d8fad53-018d-4616-a659-37ef9122f6c3)

### Alias definitions shown in `which` command

With [#17338](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/17338), the `which` command includes a `definitions` column when inspecting aliases to show the command that the alias expands to.

### Support selectors in Polars plugin

[#17296](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/17296) introduces [Polars selector](https://docs.pola.rs/api/python/stable/reference/selectors.html) support. This introduces the NuSelector type and adds following new commands.

- `polars selector all` (plugin) - Creates a selector that selects all columns.
- `polars selector by-dtype` (plugin) - Creates a selector that selects columns by data type.
- `polars selector by-name` (plugin) - Creates a selector that selects columns by name.
- `polars selector first` (plugin) - Creates a selector that selects the first column(s) by index.
- `polars selector last` (plugin) - Creates a selector that selects the last column(s) by index.

Selectors may be used with `polars select` and `polars with-column`.

### Allow serializing as raw strings in `to nuon`

[#17189](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/17189) adds a `--raw-strings` flag to `to nuon` for serializing strings with raw string syntax (`r#'...'#`) instead of strings with escapes.

### New command: `explore config` TUI

Introducing the `explore config` command.

Functionality:
- When launched with no parameters, it loads your config settings into a tree and editor to allow you to traverse, explore, and change settings.
- When launched with the `--tree` parameter, it draws a tree view of your piped in input into the terminal
- When launched with the `--use-example-data` parameter, it shows you a customized configuration (my config actually). May be removed later.
- When JSON is piped into it e.g `'{"abc": 1, "xyz": 2}' | explore config --output foo.json` it allows you to explore and edit the JSON data and save it out to the provided filename.
- When in "config mode" it shows you the nushell datatypes as you traverse the tree. When in "json" mode it shows you the json datatypes as you traverse the tree.
- When in "config mode" it shows you a description of the config setting _assuming proper documentation in doc_config.nu_. This file will need to be updated a bit in a separate PR. If there is no documentation it shows you a warning triangle by the tree item.
- As you make changes to your config, you can save those changes and they're immediately applied.
- If you hit Enter on any node leaf, you immediately jump into editing that value. If you hit Enter on tree nodes, the tree expands or collapses.

![explore-config2](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/10f4407e-28a0-4aac-8baa-88f7b95229e2)

Help
```nushell
❯ explore config --help
Launch a TUI to view and edit the nushell configuration interactively.

By default, opens the current nushell configuration ($env.config) in the TUI.
Changes made in config mode are applied to the running session when you quit.

You can also pipe JSON data to explore arbitrary data structures, or use
--use-example-data to see sample configuration data.

TUI Keybindings:
  Tab           Switch between tree and editor panes
  ↑↓            Navigate tree / scroll editor
  ←→            Collapse/Expand tree nodes
  Enter/Space   Toggle tree node expansion
  Enter/Space   On leaf nodes, open editor pane
  Enter/e       Start editing (in editor pane)
  Ctrl+Enter    Apply edit
  Esc           Cancel edit
  Ctrl+S        Save/Apply changes
  q             Quit (applies config changes if modified)
  Ctrl+C        Force quit without saving

Usage:
  > explore config {flags}

Flags:
  -h, --help: Display the help message for this command
  -e, --use-example-data: Show the nushell configuration TUI using example data
  -t, --tree: Do not show the TUI, just show a tree structure of the data
  -o, --output <string>: Optional output file to save changes to (default: output.json)

Input/output types:
  ╭─#─┬──input──┬─output─╮
  │ 0 │ nothing │ string │
  │ 1 │ string  │ string │
  ╰───┴─────────┴────────╯

Examples:
  Open the nushell configuration in an interactive TUI editor
  > explore config

  Explore JSON data interactively
  > open --raw data.json | explore config

  Explore with example data to see TUI features
  > explore config --use-example-data
```

### Improvements to `error make`

[#17070](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/17070) introduced several improvements to `error make`.

#### Creating errors more easily

`error make` can now be called without arguments:
```
> error make
Error: nu::shell::error

  × originates from here
   ╭─[entry #4:1:1]
 1 │ error make
   · ──────────
   ╰────
```

It can also be passed a single message in any of the following ways:
- Pipeline input: `{msg: foo} | error make`
- Record argument: `error make {msg: foo}`
- String argument: `error make foo`

```
Error: nu::shell::error

  × foo
   ╭─[entry #2:1:12]
 1 │ error make {msg: foo}
   ·            ──────────
   ╰────
```

#### Chaining errors together

`error make` already lets you created chained errors using `inner`, like so:
```nu
error make {msg: bar inner: [{msg: foo}]}
```

Now, you can achieve the same effect by:
- Passing a message as pipeline input: `{msg: foo} | error make bar`
- Creating an error in a `catch` block: `try {error make foo} catch {error make bar}`

Here's how that second one looks:

```
Error: nu::shell::error

  × bar
   ╭─[entry #1:1:29]
 1 │ try {error make foo} catch {error make bar}
   ·                             ──────────
   ╰────

Error: nu::shell::error

  × foo
   ╭─[entry #1:1:6]
 1 │ try {error make foo} catch {error make bar}
   ·      ──────────
   ╰────
```

#### Labels

Labels can now be created without a `text` field, like this error that only has a `span`. The span is highlighted, but with an empty label:

```
> def f [x] {
  error make {msg: here label: {span: (metadata $x).span}}
}
f abcd
Error: nu::shell::error

  × here
   ╭─[entry #7:4:3]
 3 │ }
 4 │ f abcd
   ·   ────
   ╰────
```

#### External sources

The new `src` field allows highlighting spans of text in any file, not just internal Nushell spans.

```
> "foo\nbar\nbaz" | save -f /tmp/foo.bar
error make {
  msg: 'error here'
  src: {path: /tmp/foo.bar}
  labels: [
    {text: "this" span: {start: 4 end: 7}}
  ]
}
Error: nu::shell::outside

  × error here
   ╭─[/tmp/foo.bar:2:1]
 1 │ foo
 2 │ bar
   · ─┬─
   ·  ╰── this
 3 │ baz
   ╰────
```

### Other additions

* `job flush` can now take a `--tag` to filter which messages to discard ([#17056](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/17056))
* Add `$history` variable to MCP ([#17132](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/17132))

## Removals

### Replace deprecated current_dir usage with EngineState::cwd in multiple files

[#17303](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/17303) removes some deprecated Rust functions from `nu-engine` that have been deprecated since Nushell 0.92.3:

- `current_dir_str()`
- `current_dir_str_const()`
- `current_dir()`
- `current_dir_const()`

## Other changes

### Update explore regex command to look more helpful and professional

With [#17149](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/17149), the `explore regex` UI now looks more helpful and professional.

![New explore regex UI](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/15e64dcf-96f7-4c6c-87da-b52c1f78d986)

### More descriptive error messages for `rm`

The `rm` command now provides more descriptive error messages when it runs into an IO error. Implemented in [#17134](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/17134).

### `*` no longer matches dotfiles in mv/cp/du by default

```nushell
> touch .a
> cp * /tmp
> "/tmp/.a" | path exists
false
```

But users can make it matches dotfiles by `--all(-a)` flag.

### Some Nushell commands no longer canonicalize paths

With [#17319](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/17319), `rm`, `watch`, and `source` no longer canonicalize paths. Additionally, the file path links in table view will no longer be canonicalized if you click them.

### Add REPL-style state persistence across evaluations for MCP server

With [#17121](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/17121), variables and environment changes now persist across MCP tool calls (REPL-style). This enables workflows like

```nu
$env.MY_VAR = "hello"  # First call
$env.MY_VAR             # Second call returns "hello"
```

### Use structured response format for MCP server

With [#17132](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/17132), all MCP responses will be wrapped in a structured record with:

- `history_index`: 0-based index of result in history
- `cwd`: current working directory after command
- `output`: command output (possibly truncated)

### Additional changes

* Single column dataframes (series) or expressions can now be passed into `polars is-in` ([#17275](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/17275))
* Lists can now be passed into `polars lit` ([#17275](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/17275))
* `bytes length` can now be used at const time ([#17204](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/17204))
* Add a quick reference panel to `explore regex` with the F1 keybinding and dismiss it with the ESC keybinding. ([#17187](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/17187))
* Within the `explore` command the `:nu` command will now stream content by spawning the command issues without blocking. ([#17208](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/17208))
* `--help` is now available for `debug env`. ([#17278](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/17278))
* This PR adds the `memory_size()` function on nushell `Value` so that we can get the size of variables to understand them better. ([#17287](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/17287))
* Update agents.md for better LLM use. ([#17318](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/17318))
* Make `detect type` more robust with datetime handling by updating regular expressions ([#17357](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/17357))

## Bug fixes

### Fixed parsing of ranges with parentheses

Ranges that include a parenthesized expression will now be parsed correctly after [#17109](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/17109). The below example will now evaluate to the range `0..1` rather than being parsed as an invalid three-part range `0..(1..2`.

```nu
0..(1..2 | first)
```

### Fixed parsing issue with multiarm match + guard

Match statements with multiple alarms and a guard expression, such as the below example, will now be parsed correctly after [#17115](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/17115). Previously, such an expression would fail to parse.

```nu
match 3 {
  1 | 2 | 3 if true => 'test'
}
```

### Infinite sequences cant be terminated when piped to other command

```
> `1..inf | to md`  # then press ctrl-c
^CError: nu::shell::error

  × Operation interrupted
   ╭─[entry #1:1:1]
 1 │ 1..inf | to md
   · ───────┬──────
   ·        ╰── This operation was interrupted
   ╰────
```

### Pipefail works with `try` block

With [#17052](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/17052), the following code will  an empty list with additional `1`, because the command is failed actually.

```nu
> nu --experimental-options=[pipefail]
> try {
  ^false | lines
} catch {|e|
  print $e.exit_code
}
```

### Nushell exits early when running scripts or commands with bad config files

With [#17103](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/17103), if a script or command is run with a `config.nu` or `env.nu` that can't be evaluated, Nushell will exit.

```nu
echo 'errnocmd' | save config.nu
nu --config config.nu -c 'echo $env.NU_VERSION'
```

This will exit with status code 1 rather than printing the Nushell version.

### Fix `http` DNS resolution "Service not supported" error in Docker containers

With [#17125](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/17125), `http` commands will no longer error with "Service not supported for this socket type" in certain Linux environments (particularly Docker containers running Debian Trixie).

### Fix variables remaining active after `overlay hide`

[#17130](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/17130) makes overlays work more reliably inside scripts.

```
#!/usr/bin/env nu

def something [] { "example" }

module spam {}
overlay use spam
def bar [] { "bar" }
overlay hide spam
bar
```

Previously, `bar` would be available to use even after `overlay hide spam`. This has been fixed.

### Other fixes

* Type mismatch errors no longer list the same type multiple times ([#17075](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/17075))
* Allow creating aliases for commands with required flags ([#17106](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/17106))
* `rm` can now delete broken symlinks on Windows ([#17320](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/17320))
* `format date` can see locale environment variables set by `with-env` ([#17333](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/17333))
* Changes to `$env.config` outside of `config.nu` are reflected in more places ([17058](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/17058))
* Multiplying duration by integers now throws an error on overflow ([#17063](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/17063))
* rm command will return error when there is one file is failed to remove. ([#17237](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/17237))
* Changed the behavior of `cal --month-names` to create a new `month_name` column instead of overriding `month`. ([#17302](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/17302))
* `glob` no longer canonicalizes paths internally ([#17312](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/17312))
* Fixed the issue where "Duplicate Pane" in Windows Terminal failed when the current path contained Chinese characters by removing unnecessary URL-encoding in OSC 9;9 sequences. ([#17311](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/17311))
* Enable `detect columns` to be more robust, specifically for handling the output of tablelike structures that are created with ascii or unicode table characters like we use in nushell today. Many tools are starting to use this columnar data output so hopefully this will enable nushell to be able to parse this data better. ([#17317](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/17317))
* General speed up increase in the `ls` command by caching and not calling `metadata()` so frequently. ([#17339](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/17339))
* `input -s` will append newline when user finishes typing. ([#17298](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/17298))
* `std/help`: Add colors, proper examples, fix output ([#17010](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/17010))
* `table -i false` no longer panic when there is an index column, e.g: `[{index: 0, data: yes}] | table -i false` ([#17126](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/17126))
