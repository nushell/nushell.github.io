# Nushell 0.108.0

Today, we're releasing version 0.108.0 of Nu. This release adds an optional MCP server for AI agents, new experimental options (`pipefail` and `enforce-runtime-annotations`), smarter completions with per-command completers, clearer errors and better streaming behavior, `reorder-cell-paths` enabled by default, and stronger `CustomValue` support.

# Where to get it

Nu 0.108.0 is available as [pre-built binaries](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/releases/tag/0.108.0) or from [crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/nu). If you have Rust installed you can install it using `cargo install nu`.

As part of this release, we also publish a set of optional [plugins](https://www.nushell.sh/book/plugins.html) you can install and use with Nushell.

# Highlights and themes of this release [[toc](#table-of-contents)]

## Let AI agents use Nushell commands [[toc](#table-of-contents)]

Thanks to [@ayax79](https://github.com/ayax79), this release adds an [MCP server](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/getting-started/intro) for Nushell, allowing AI agents to run Nushell commands.

To use it, compile Nushell with the `mcp` feature (it's not included by default), then start the server with:

```nu
nu --mcp
```

This is a brand new feature and will keep evolving as we refine it.
You can join the discussion on our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/NtAbbGn) in [#ai-with-nu](https://discord.com/channels/601130461678272522/1420802579155390616).

## More cool experiments [[toc](#table-of-contents)]

This release brings two new experimental options.
You can read more about experimental features [here](./2025-07-23-nushell_0_106_0.html#new-experimental-options-toc).

First, `pipefail`, added by [@WindSoilder](https://github.com/WindSoilder).
When enabled, `$env.LAST_EXIT_CODE` will be set to the exit code of the rightmost command in a pipeline that exited with a non-zero status, or zero if all commands succeeded.
When used together with `$env.config.display_errors.exit_code = true`, Nushell will also report which command failed.
See some examples [here](#pipefail-16449-toc).

Second, `enforce-runtime-annotations`, added by [@mkatychev](https://github.com/mkatychev).
When enabled, Nushell will catch errors at runtime when assigning values to type-annotated variables.
Without it, type annotations are only checked at parse time.
This helps catch tricky type errors during execution.
Read more about it [here](#enforce-assignment-type-annotations-at-runtime-16079-toc).

We also promoted one of our experimental options from _opt-in_ to _opt-out_, so it’s now enabled by default: `reorder-cell-paths`.
It improves performance by reordering how cell-paths are evaluated, making lookups faster.
If it causes any issues, you can disable it by setting `reorder-cell-paths=false` in your experimental options.
More info [here](#promoted-reorder-cell-paths-to-opt-out-16795-toc).

[Learn how to enable experimental options.](#additions-toc)

## Tab, tab, tab... Aha! [[toc](#table-of-contents)]

Thanks to [@Bahex](https://github.com/Bahex), tab completion just got a lot smarter!
[A ton of built-in commands](#guess-no-more-more-completions-in-built-in-commands-16383-toc) now come with handy suggestions.
Custom commands can use [a new, easy syntax](#simple-syntax-for-simple-completions-16789-toc) to add their own completions.
And for full control, you can now pick which completer to use by [adding the `@complete` attribute](#command-wide-completion-handler-16765-toc) to your commands.

## Fish out error sources [[toc](#table-of-contents)]

Some errors hiding inside other commands weren’t showing up quite right.
[@Bahex](https://github.com/Bahex) fixed that by making [stream collection raise an error when the stream itself contains one](#collecting-a-stream-that-contains-errors-now-raises-an-error-itself-16738-toc).
Errors inside `each` calls also now [keep their full context](#errors-raised-in-nested-each-calls-preserve-their-context-toc), making it easier to track down what went wrong.

## Smarter `CustomValue`s [[toc](#table-of-contents)]

`CustomValue`s let plugin authors introduce their own data types without being limited to Nushell's built-in `Value`s.
Until now, though, they often lagged behind in functionality.
Thanks to [@cptpiepmatz](https://github.com/cptpiepmatz), they’re now much closer to behaving like regular `Value`s.

They now support both the `$value!` syntax added by [@Bahex](https://github.com/Bahex) in [0.105.0](./2025-06-10-nushell_0_105_0.html#case-sensitive-cell-paths-or-not-toc) and the older `$value?` syntax.
Plugin authors can now decide exactly how these should behave for their custom types.

On top of that, `CustomValue`s now work with the `save` command.
Plugin authors can define how their custom data should be saved, which is often more complex than for built-in types.

See the [notes for plugin developers](#notes-for-plugin-developers-toc) for more details.

# Changes [[toc](#table-of-contents)]

## Breaking changes [[toc](#table-of-contents)]

### `into value` is now `detect type`, and `into value` now converts custom values to plain values ([#16697]) [[toc](#table-of-contents)]

Until 0.107, `into value` tried to detect the types of table cells. It converted strings into typed values, which is where the name came from. But it didn't match the purpose of the other `into` commands.
This command is now called `detect type` but it doesn't operate on cells anymore, so you have to call `update cells {detect type}` to use that functionality again. With that we can also use that command on non-table types to try to infer the types.
The `into value` name is now used for converting custom values from plugins into native Nushell values.

The `table` command already showed the base Nushell value:

```ansi:no-line-numbers

string[0m
```

### Collecting a stream that contains errors now raises an error itself ([#16738]) [[toc](#table-of-contents)]

Previously, if an error was returned as a stream item and you collected that stream into a value, you would and up with a list that has an `error` item which you wouldn't know about until you interacted with that specific item.

You could even end up with a list entirely made up of `error`s:

```nushell
let items = 1..10 | each {|n| error make { msg: $"Error ($n)" } }
items | describe
# list<error>
```

With this release that's no longer the case:

```nushell
let items = 1..10 | each {|n| error make { msg: $"Error ($n)" } }
```

```ansi:no-line-numbers
Error: [31mnu::shell::eval_block_with_input

[39m  [31m×[39m Eval block failed with pipeline input
   ╭─[[22;1;36;4mentry #4:1:13[22;39;24m]

[22;39m   ╰────[m
```

Simply attempting to collect such a stream immediately re-throws the first error encountered.

This also has the effect of preserving the context of errors raised some nested command calls like...

### Errors raised in nested `each` calls preserve their context [[toc](#table-of-contents)]

Previously, errors raised in nested `each` calls (and other commands that returned streams) could lose their outer/caller context.

If the closure returned a stream, errors in the stream were not properly chained and lost this context. Running the following code:

```nushell
0..1 | each {
    0..1 | each {|e|
        error make {msg: boom}
    }
}
```

we get:

### Changes to `EditCommand`s ([#16841]) [[toc](#table-of-contents)]

- renamed `cutinside` to `cutinsidepair`
- renamed `yankinside` to `copyinsidepair`
- added `cutaroundpair`
- added `copyaroundpair`
- added `cuttextobject`
- added `copytextobject`

### Vi Mode Text Objects ([#16841]) [[toc](#table-of-contents)]

Vi mode now supports inner and around (`i` and `a`) text objects for:

- word, bound to `w` (a sequence of letters, digits and underscores, separated with white space)
- WORD, bound to `W` (a sequence of non-blank characters, separated with white space)
- brackets, bound to `b` (any of `( )`, `[ ]`, `{ }`)
- quotes, bound to `q` (any of `" "`, `' '`, ` `` `)

Existing "pair" motions for specific matching pairs (e.g. `di(` or `ci"`) are also extended to support "around" versions (e.g. `da(` or `ca"`) that cover the pair characters.

Additionally, the pair motions will now jump to the next pair if non are found within search range.

- For _symmetric pairs_ like quotes, searching is restricted to the current line.
- For _asymmetric pairs_ like brackets, search is multi-line across the whole buffer.

Symmetric pairs search does not do any parsing or matching of pairs based on language/groupings.
It simply searches for the previous and next matching characters.

### Other breaking changes [[toc](#table-of-contents)]

- The LSP session is no longer marked as interactive (`$nu.is-interactive == false`) ([#16580])

- The Polars plugin's value types are renamed to be prefixed with `polars_` (e.g. polars_dataframe) ([#16819])

## Additions [[toc](#table-of-contents)]

::: tip Experimental Options

Opt-in experimental options can be enabled and opt-out options can disabled using the command-line argument:

```nushell
nu --experimental-options '[foo,bar=false]'
```

or the environment variable:

```nushell
NU_EXPERIMENTAL_OPTIONS="foo,bar=false" nu
```

Or if you're feeling adventurous you can enable all of them with `all`

```nushell
nu --experimental-options '[all]'
NU_EXPERIMENTAL_OPTIONS="all" nu
```

:::

### Promoted `reorder-cell-paths` to opt-out ([#16795]) [[toc](#table-of-contents)]

In Nushell 0.106.0, [experimental options](https://www.nushell.sh/blog/2025-07-23-nushell_0_106_0.html#experimental-options-toc) were added, first of which is [`reorder-cell-paths`](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/issues/16766). With this release `reorder-cell-paths` is promoted to being opt-out, meaning that by default this experimental option is enabled now.

This option improves cell-path accesses by reordering how the cell-path should be evaluated without modifying the output in any way.

If you experience any trouble with this, you can disable it via passing `reorder-cell-paths=false` via the command-line argument or environment variable.

### Pipefail ([#16449]) [[toc](#table-of-contents)]

This release adds a new experimental option: `pipefail`.

When enabled, `$env.LAST_EXIT_CODE` will be set to the exit code of rightmost command in the pipeline which exit with a non-zero status, or zero if all commands in the pipeline exit successfully.

```nushell
> ^false | print aa
aa
> $env.LAST_EXIT_CODE
1
```

Using it together with `$env.config.display_errors.exit_code = true` will report the command that failed:

```nushell
> $env.config.display_errors.exit_code = true
> ^ls | ^false | print aa
aa
```

```ansi:no-line-numbers
aa
Error: [31mnu::shell::non_zero_exit_code

```

### Enforce Assignment Type Annotations at Runtime ([#16079]) [[toc](#table-of-contents)]

Nushell is perfectly capable of catching type errors at parse time...

```nushell
let table1: table<a: string> = [{a: "foo"}]
let table2: table<b: string> = $table1
```

```ansi:no-line-numbers
Error: [31mnu::parser::type_mismatch

[39m  [31m×[39m Type mismatch.
   ╭─[[22;1;36;4mentry #1:2:32[22;39;24m]
 [22;2m1[22m │ let table1: table<a: string> = [{a: "foo"}]
 [22;2m2[22m │ let table2: table<b: string> = $table1
   · [22;1;35m                               ───┬───
[22;39m   ·                                   [22;1;35m╰── expected table<b: string>, found table<a: string>
[22;39m   ╰────[0m
```

But only if the relevant types are known at parse time.

```nushell
let table1: table  = ({a: 1} | into record | to nuon | from nuon);
let table2: table<b: string> = $table1
# * crickets *
```

Which can lead to some unexpected results:

```nushell
let x: table<b: string> = ({a: 1} | to nuon | from nuon)
$x | describe
# record<a: int>
```

This release adds a new experimental option: [`enforce-runtime-annotations`](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/issues/16832)

When it's enabled, nushell can catch this class of type errors at runtime, and throw a `cant_convert` error:

```ansi:no-line-numbers

This would be a breaking change for scripts where `any` coercion/conversions previously ignored field constraints for records and tables, which is why it's being phased in with an experimental option.

### `--endian` flag for `format bits` ([#16574]) [[toc](#table-of-contents)]

`format bits` used to output in native endian, until Nu 0.107.0 (#16435) changed it to big endian. Now, you will be able to choose the behavior with `--endian` (use `format bits --endian native` to get the original behavior from before Nu 0.107.0).

```nushell
~> 258 | format bits
00000001 00000010
```

```nushell
~> 258 | format bits --endian little # (or `--endian native` in a little endian system)
00000010 00000001
```

### Guess no more! More completions in built-in commands ([#16383]) [[toc](#table-of-contents)]

Thanks to some recent improvements behind the scenes, nushell built-in commands that expect a specific set of values now suggests these values.

The following commands now have suggestions:

- `random uuid --version <...> --namespace <...>`
- `into int --endian <...>`
- `into duration --unit <...>`
- `into datetime --timezone <...>`
- `histogram --percentage-type <...>`
- `http* --redirect-mode <...>`
- `fill --alignment <...>`
- `cal --week-start <...>`
- `date to-timezone <...>`
- `attr deprecated --report <...>`
- `merge deep --strategy <...>`
- `from csv`, `from tsv`: `--trim <...>`
- `table --theme <...>`
- `split list --split <...>`

### Simple syntax for simple completions ([#16789]) [[toc](#table-of-contents)]

Custom completions are powerful, able to provide dynamic completions based on what's written on the command line so far.

But you don't always need that power. In fact, for most cases a simple static list of options is enough.

To make it simpler and more concise to meet this need, this release adds a new way to define completions for command parameters:

```ansi:no-line-numbers
[1;36mdef[0m [32mgo[0m [1;32m[
    direction: string@[ left up right down ]
][0m [1;32m{[0m[1;32m
    [0m[35m$direction[0m[1;32m
[0m[1;32m}[0m
```

Completions can be provided as a list of strings inline in the command signature, or stored in a `const` variable and used like that.

```ansi:no-line-numbers
[1;36mconst[0m [35mdirections[0m = [1;36m[ [0m[32mleft[0m[1;36m [0m[32mup[0m[1;36m [0m[32mright[0m[1;36m [0m[32mdown[0m[1;36m ][0m

[1;36mdef[0m [32mgo[0m [1;32m[ direction: string@$directions ][0m [1;32m{[0m[1;32m
    [0m[35m$direction[0m[1;32m
[0m[1;32m}[0m
```

### Command-wide completion handler ([#16765]) [[toc](#table-of-contents)]

There is big difference between custom completions that can be specified in a command's signature, and the "global" external completer (`$env.config.completions.external.completer`).

The former is added to individual parameters, while the latter provides completions for all arguments of (external) commands.

This makes using custom commands that wrap external commands awkward. The global external completer won't provide completions for the wrapper command and adding completions to that command uses a completely different API. It would be nice to be able to use the external completer's API for custom completions, or use the external completer for wrapper commands...

#### `@complete external`

Now it's possible to explicitly enable the global external completer for `extern` and custom command `def`initions:

```nushell
@complete external
def --wrapped jc [...args] {
    ^jc ...$args | from json
}
```

#### `@complete <completer>`

Instead of using the external completer, command-wide custom completers can be used for specific commands:

```nushell
def carapace-completer [spans: list<string>] {
    ^carapace ..
}

@complete carapace-completer
def --env get-env [name] { $env | get $name }

@complete carapace-completer
def --env set-env [name, value] { load-env { $name: $value } }

@complete carapace-completer
def --env unset-env [name] { hide-env $name }
```

Combined with `extern` definitions, this makes it trivial to use specific completion sources for specific commands:

```nushell
def fish-completer [spans: list<string>] {
	^fish ..
}

@complete fish-completer
extern git []

@complete fish-completer
extern asdf []
```

Yes, you can remove the `match` expression from your external completer!

```nushell
{|spans: list<string>|

    # ...

    # no need for this anymore!
    match $spans.0 {
        # fish completes commits and branch names in a nicer way
        git => $fish_completer
        # carapace doesn't have completions for asdf
        asdf => $fish_completer
        _ => $carapace_completer
    } | do $in $spans
```

<details>
    <summary>Full implementation of <code>fish-completer</code> from the cookbook.</summary>

```nushell
def fish-completer [spans: list<string>] {
	^fish --command $"complete '--do-complete=($spans | str replace --all "'" "\\'" | str join ' ')'"
	| from tsv --flexible --noheaders --no-infer
	| rename value description
	| update value {|row|
		let value = $row.value
		let need_quote = ['\' ',' '[' ']' '(' ')' ' ' '\t' "'" '"' "`"] | any { $in in $value }
		if ($need_quote and ($value | path exists)) {
			let expanded_path = if ($value starts-with ~) { $value | path expand --no-symlink } else { $value }
			$'"($expanded_path | str replace --all "\"" "\\\"")"'
		} else { $value }
	}
}
```

</details>

### `for` loops no longer collect their source ([#16593]) [[toc](#table-of-contents)]

Previously, `for` loops only worked with values (ranges, lists, etc), so using them with streaming commands would collect the whole stream before iteration could start. Now it also works with streams too!

This makes it possible to use it with slow or unbounded streams:

```nushell
for event in (watch . --glob=**/*.rs) {
	cargo test
}
```

### Streams of Streams ([#16735]) [[toc](#table-of-contents)]

When you run `each` over a list (or stream), it can only return a single item for each input. When we need to create multiple values from a single input, we can just return a list in the closure and run the output through `flatten`.

```nushell
each { .. } | flatten
```

When the closure itself generates a _stream_ however, that pattern can be inadequate, as the stream has to be collected into a list, just to be flattened afterwards. This might increase memory usage, and result in unnecessary waits.

To address this, `each` has a new flag: `--flatten`

`each --flatten` does not wait to collect closure output to ensure returning a single output item for each input, instead the stream from the closure is directly passed through. Here's a demonstration of differences:

<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>

```nushell:title="each | flatten"
def slow-source [range: range] {
    $range | each {|e| sleep 0.1sec; $e }
}

0..5..<25
| each {|e| slow-source ($e)..<($e + 5) }
| flatten
| each {|e| print $e; $e}
| ignore
```

</td>
<td>

```nushell:title="each --flatten"
#
def slow-source [range: range] {
    $range | each {|e| sleep 0.1sec; $e }
}

0..5..<25
| each --flatten {|e| slow-source ($e)..<($e + 5) }
| each {|e| print $e; $e}
| ignore
```

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="50%">

</td>

### Arbitrary Pipeline Metadata ([#16821]) [[toc](#table-of-contents)]

In addition to existing metadata fields (`content_type`, `source`, `span`), it's now possible to attach arbitrary metadata fields to pipeline data using `metadata set --merge`:

```nushell
"data" | metadata set --merge {custom_key: "value"} | metadata | get custom_key
```

Combined with `metadata access`, this makes it possible to carry extra data with streams, without impacting the stream data itself.

### HTTP Response Metadata ([#16821]) [[toc](#table-of-contents)]

All `http` commands now attach response data (previously only accessible with `http * --full`) as metadata to their output streams. This can be accessed under the `http_response` field within the pipeline metadata:

- `status` - HTTP status code
- `headers` - Response headers as `[{name, value}, ...]`
- `urls` - Redirect history

Accessing this metadata after the response completes may not offer much benefit.

```nushell
http get https://api.example.com | metadata | get http_response.status
# => 200
```

Where it shines is accessing it _alongside_ the streaming response body using `metadata access`:

```nushell
http get --allow-errors https://api.example.com/events.jsonl
| metadata access {|meta|
    if $meta.http_response.status != 200 {
        error make {msg: "failed"}
    } else { }
  }
| lines
| each { from json }
| where event_type == "error"
```

### Add `$nu.is-lsp` to help with printing in lsp mode ([#16635]) [[toc](#table-of-contents)]

When nushell is launched with the `--lsp` flag, nushell will set `$nu.is-lsp` to true so that users can programmatically know when nushell is in LSP mode.

When in LSP mode, the `print` command will only print to stderr. This is done to prevent the LSP from misbehaving when it sees text that isn't JSON-RPC in stdout, which is being listened to by the LSP.

### New Configuration Option: `$env.config.table.batch_duration` ([#16629]) [[toc](#table-of-contents)]

It is now possible to configure the batch duration for the `table` command.

The `table` command (and by proxy the default pipeline output) handles streaming in batches to avoid long wait times until any data is visible. With the `$env.config.table.batch_duration` option, it is now possible to define this time it will collect a batch. This is by default 1 second as it was previously a hard-coded value.

Default setting and previous output:

```nushell
1..=6 | each {|i| sleep 1sec; $i | into string | $"after ($in) sec"}
# ╭───┬─────────────╮
# │ 0 │ after 1 sec │
# ╰───┴─────────────╯
# ╭───┬─────────────╮
# │ 1 │ after 2 sec │
# ╰───┴─────────────╯
# ╭───┬─────────────╮
# │ 2 │ after 3 sec │
# ╰───┴─────────────╯
# ╭───┬─────────────╮
# │ 3 │ after 4 sec │
# ╰───┴─────────────╯
# ╭───┬─────────────╮
# │ 4 │ after 5 sec │
# ╰───┴─────────────╯
# ╭───┬─────────────╮
# │ 5 │ after 6 sec │
# ╰───┴─────────────╯
```

Configured to wait for two seconds:

```nushell
$env.config.table.batch_duration = 2sec
1..=6 | each {|i| sleep 1sec; $i | into string | $"after ($in) sec"}
# ╭───┬─────────────╮
# │ 0 │ after 1 sec │
# │ 1 │ after 2 sec │
# ╰───┴─────────────╯
# ╭───┬─────────────╮
# │ 2 │ after 3 sec │
# │ 3 │ after 4 sec │
# ╰───┴─────────────╯
# ╭───┬─────────────╮
# │ 4 │ after 5 sec │
# │ 5 │ after 6 sec │
# ╰───┴─────────────╯
```

### New Configuration Option: `$env.config.table.stream_page_size` ([#16629]) [[toc](#table-of-contents)]

It is now possible to configure the maximum page size of streamed data in the `table` command.

The `table` command (and by proxy the default pipeline output) chunks streamed data into separate tables according to the stream page size which can now be set via `$env.config.table.stream_page_size`. By default it's 1000, so (if fast enough) it will collect 1000 entries into a single table and then start a new table.

Default setting and previous output:

```nushell
1..4 | each {"item " + ($in | into string)}
# ╭───┬────────╮
# │ 0 │ item 1 │
# │ 1 │ item 2 │
# │ 2 │ item 3 │
# │ 3 │ item 4 │
# ╰───┴────────╯
```

Configured to page at maximum 2 entries:

```nushell
$env.config.table.stream_page_size = 2
1..4 | each {"item " + ($in | into string)}
# ╭───┬────────╮
# │ 0 │ item 1 │
# │ 1 │ item 2 │
# ╰───┴────────╯
# ╭───┬────────╮
# │ 2 │ item 3 │
# │ 3 │ item 4 │
# ╰───┴────────╯
```

### Table literal columns support variables ([#16669]) [[toc](#table-of-contents)]

Table literals can now have variables in the column names list. For example, this is now allowed:

```ansi:no-line-numbers
[38;5;6m> [1;36mlet [0m[35mcolumn_name [39m= [32m'column0'[0m

### Add %J and %Q format specifiers for compact date/time formatting ([#16588]) [[toc](#table-of-contents)]

The `format date` and `into datetime` commands now support two new format specifiers for creating compact, sortable date and time components:

- **%J** produces compact dates in `YYYYMMDD` format (e.g., `20250918`)
- **%Q** produces compact times in `HHMMSS` format (e.g., `131144`)

These can be used individually for date-only or time-only formatting, or combined for full timestamps (`%J_%Q` produces `20250918_131144`), providing more flexibility than a single combined format.

Perfect for:

- Backup file naming with custom separators
- Log file timestamps with flexible formatting
- Date-only or time-only compact representations
- Any scenario requiring sortable, human-readable date/time components

Both commands use the same format specifications, ensuring consistency when parsing and formatting dates.

This addition is fully backward compatible - all existing format specifiers continue to work unchanged.

### Add configuration for columnar menu traversal direction ([#16724]) [[toc](#table-of-contents)]

The feature makes it possible to choose the direction that items are placed in the columnar menu. With the default value of `"horizontal"`, items are ordered left-to-right in each row, with later items appearing in rows below earlier items.

```
1   2   3   4
5   6   7   8
9   10
```

With the value set to `"vertical"`, items are ordered top-to-bottom in each column, with later items appearing in columns to the right of earlier items.

```
1   4   7   10
2   5   8
3   6   9
```

The configuration option is currently called "tab_traversal" with a default value of "horizontal".

In order to toggle horizontal or vertical, add or update the completion_menu in your config.nu

```nushell
# Example - Completion menu configuration
$env.config.menus ++= [{
    name: completion_menu
    only_buffer_difference: false     # Search is done on the text written after activating the menu
    marker: "| "                      # Indicator that appears with the menu is active
    type: {
        layout: columnar              # Type of menu
        columns: 4                    # Number of columns where the options are displayed
        col_width: 20                 # Optional value. If missing all the screen width is used to calculate column width
        col_padding: 2                # Padding between columns
        tab_traversal: "horizontal"   # Direction in which pressing <Tab> will cycle through options, "horizontal" or "vertical"
    }
    style: {
        text: green                   # Text style
        selected_text: green_reverse  # Text style for selected option
        description_text: yellow      # Text style for description
    }
}]
```

### Nushell MCP Server ([#16693], [#16758], [#16839], [#16857]) [[toc](#table-of-contents)]

When compiled with the "mcp" feature (not a part of the default feature set), the nushell binary can be used as a local (stdio) MCP server.

To start the nushell MCP server

```nu
nu --mcp
```

This will allow a local AI agent to use MCP to execute native nushell commands and external commands.

### Add `--chars` to `str length` command ([#16768]) [[toc](#table-of-contents)]

The `str length` command now has a `--chars` flag to allow you to count characters.

```nushell
> 'hällo' | str length --chars
  5
```

### The `to md` command now always returns valid Markdown tables ([#16681]) [[toc](#table-of-contents)]

Previously, a command like this:

```shell
> [['foo' 'bar']; ['1 | 2' 'a | b']] | to md
|foo|bar|
|-|-|
|1 | 2|a | b|
```

would generate an invalid table, since the `|` characters inside the cell content were not escaped.

Now, such special characters are automatically escaped, ensuring the output always follows proper Markdown table syntax:

```shell
> [['foo' 'bar']; ['1 | 2' 'a | b']] | to md
| foo | bar |
| --- | --- |
| 1 \| 2 | a \| b |
```

### New switches are available for `to md` ([#16681]) [[toc](#table-of-contents)]

- `--escape-md` | `-m` escape all Markdown special characters
- `--escape-html` | `-t` escape HTML special characters
- `--escape-all` | `-a` escape both HTML and Markdown

### `compact` your records ([#16810]) [[toc](#table-of-contents)]

`compact` can now be used to remove `null` or `--empty` items from records too.

### Breaking changes [[toc](#table-of-contents)]

### `collect` removes `source` metadata ([#16821]) [[toc](#table-of-contents)]

`collect` now removes `source` metadata field even when `content_type` is set.
Previously: both were preserved, now only `content_type` is preserved.

### `string`s and `glob`s can now be implicitly cast between each other ([#16079]) [[toc](#table-of-contents)]

Previously `string` types were not able to be coerced into `glob` types (and vice versa).
They are now subtypes of each other.

Before:

```nushell
> def spam [foo: glob] { echo $foo }; let f = 'aa'; spam $f
Error: nu::shell::cant_convert

  × Can't convert to glob.
   ╭─[entry #109:1:56]
 1 │ def spam [foo: glob] { echo $foo }; let f = 'aa'; spam $f
   ·                                                        ─┬

   ╰────
```

Now:

```nushell
> def spam [foo: glob] { echo $foo }; let f = 'aa'; spam $f
aa
```

### Other additions [[toc](#table-of-contents)]

- Added support for exabyte and exbibyte filesize format. ([#16689])

- Experimental options now provide two new fields `since` and `issue` which refer to when the experimental option was introduced and an issue on Github that tracks the status of that issue. You can see them via `debug experimental-options`. ([#16142])

- New operators: `not-starts-with` and `not-ends-with`. Added for parity with other comparison operators. ([#16852])

- Added file completions for command redirections (`o>>`, `e>`, ...) ([#16831])

## Other changes [[toc](#table-of-contents)]

### Add `run pr` and `download pr` to `toolkit` ([#16770]) [[toc](#table-of-contents)]

The toolkit in the Nushell repository can now download and run PRs by downloading artifacts from CI runs. It can be run like this:

```nushell
use toolkit
toolkit run pr <number>
```

### Add `network` feature to top-level crate ([#16686]) [[toc](#table-of-contents)]

Nushell can now be compiled without network related commands.

If you are manually building Nushell without default features (`cargo build --no-default-features`) you will now need to pass `--features network` to get access the network commands.

### Improved error messages for binary literals ([#16688]) [[toc](#table-of-contents)]

Previously, a generic shell error is thrown for invalid binary strings. Now, an improve error message is thrown for invalid binary, hexadecimal, and octal strings.

```nushell
0b[121]
```

```ansi:no-line-numbers
Error: [31mnu::parser::invalid_binary_string

```

### Polars 50.1 upgrade ([#16703]) [[toc](#table-of-contents)]

- `polars fetch` has been removed due to no longer being supported on LazyFrame
- introduced flag `--drop-nulls` to `polars dummies`
- introduced flag `--separator` to `polars dummies`
- introduced flag `--strict` to `polars integer`
- introduced flag `--base` to `polars integer`
- introduced flag `--dtype` to `polars integer`
- introduced flag `--stable` to `polars pivot`
- polars pivot will no longer perform a stable pivot by default, the flag `--stable` must be passed in to perform a stable pivot.
- Introduced flag `--time-zone` to `polars as-datetime`
- Introduced flag `--time-unit` to `polars as-datetime`

### Additional changes [[toc](#table-of-contents)]

- The `which` command now lists all commands (internal and external) when no argument is passed to it ([#16551])

## Bug fixes [[toc](#table-of-contents)]

### Aliases are now expanded before being sent to external completers ([#16640]) [[toc](#table-of-contents)]

Before this change, when an external completer was invoked for an alias, the first argument sent to the completer would be the alias itself instead of the aliased command.

For example, with an alias defined as `alias gl = git log`, typing `gl branch_name` and pressing `TAB` would send the arguments `gl`, `log`, `branch_name` to the external completer.

After this change, the alias is expanded and the arguments sent to the external completer will be `git`, `log`, `branch_name`.

### Discard `path add` input ([#16606]) [[toc](#table-of-contents)]

Previously `path add` (from `std/util`) could fail if it was fed `any` input.

```ansi:no-line-numbers

```

Now any input to `path add` will be discarded. It's still possible to pass it with `$in`:

```nushell
[a b c] | each {|p| $env.HOME | path join $p } | path add $in
```

### Fixed IR evaluation error caused by redirecting output of branched blocks ([#16676]) [[toc](#table-of-contents)]

The following commands will no longer raise ir-eval errors:

- `if true { echo "hey" } out> /dev/null`
- `if false { echo "hey" } else { echo "ho" } out> /dev/null`
- `try { 1/0 } catch { echo "hi" } out> /dev/null`

### Dotnu completion refactor, fixes path with space for both dotnu module path and external executable ([#16715]) [[toc](#table-of-contents)]

Module path completion for command `use`/`source` now behaviors in the same manner of basic file completion, which is less error prone when dealing with paths with spaces or other special characters.

Fixed the bug of empty result of external executable path completion at the head of a pipeline when the path prefix contains spaces.

### boolean coloring in light theme ([#16722]) [[toc](#table-of-contents)]

When using `std/config light-theme`, booleans inside structures are now colored in dark cyan instead of white, which was very hard to read in combination with a light terminal background.

### changed fallback for unknown color names ([#16722]) [[toc](#table-of-contents)]

If some named color in `$env.config.color_config` is misspelled or otherwise unknown to nu, the corresponding element is now colored using the terminal's default (as in `ansi reset`) instead of white.

### Improve collection type inference ([#16530]) [[toc](#table-of-contents)]

Fixes order-dependent table type inference bugs and introduces similar type widening for lists:

```nushell
def get_type [] { scope variables | where name == "$foo" | first | get type }

let foo = [ [bar]; [ { baz: 1 } ], [ { baz: 1, extra: true } ] ]
get_type # table<bar: record<baz: int, extra: bool>> -> table<bar: record<baz: int>>

let foo = [ [bar]; [ { baz: 1, extra: true } ], [ { baz: 1 } ] ]
get_type # table<bar: any> -> table<bar: record<baz: int>>

let foo = [ { baz: 1 }, { baz: 1, extra: true } ]
get_type # list<any> -> list<record<baz: int>>
```

### Using `break`/`continue` outside loops raises a compile error ([#16740]) [[toc](#table-of-contents)]

Previously this error wasn't caught during compilation, and manifested as a runtime error when the execution reached the invalid `break`/`continue` call.

```ansi:no-line-numbers title="Before"

### Windows device path fixes ([#16775]) [[toc](#table-of-contents)]

- On Windows, UNC and device paths no longer get a trailing `\` appended when being cast to `path`
- On Windows, `open`, `save` and `source` now work with device paths like `\\.\NUL` or `\\.\CON`, as well as reserved device names like `NUL` and `CON`. Using full device paths is recommended.

### Clean up error handlers when jumping outside of `try` blocks ([#16838]) [[toc](#table-of-contents)]

Previously, jumping out of a `try` block (possible with `break`/`continue` commands) did not clean up the error handler properly the way exiting it normally does.

So when an error was thrown afterwards, the error handler would catch it and continue execution in the `catch` block...

```
                 do {
                     loop {
                         try {         throwing an error jumps
                 ┌───────────break     into the catch block!!
                 │       } catch {◄───────────────────────────┐
 break jumps out │           print 'jumped to catch block'    │
 of the loop     │           return                           │
 as expected     │       }                                    │
                 └──►}                                        │
                     error make -u {msg: "success"}───────────┘
                 }
```

This was due to a miscompilation bug, which is now fixed.

### Other fixes [[toc](#table-of-contents)]

- `compact --empty` now recognizes 0 byte binary values as empty ([#16810])

- Fixed associative equality comparison for floats. ([#16549])

- The `**` (power) operator now parses as right-associative instead of left-associative, matching standard mathematical behavior. ([#16552])

- `port <start> <end>` on Windows now properly finds open TCP ports. ([#16546])

- Fixed a panic when `duration`s were created with a value outside of the supported value range with certain unit suffixes. ([#16594])

- Fixes an issue in `std help externs` - it was using a column that is no longer present. ([#16590])

- The LSP should now work better with unsaved files and with overlays used as prefixes (ex. `overlay use foo as bar --prefix`) ([#16568])

- Variables defined as custom command arguments show now be available to autocomplete inside that command. ([#16531])

- Fixed building `nu-command` by itself. ([#16616])

- `for` and `while` loop blocks starting with a range literal no longer causes a compiler error ([#16764])

- Some `attr` subcommands had incorrect output signatures, which are now fixed. ([#16774])

- For commands expecting directory arguments, regular files will no longer be suggested as completions as a fallback for when no directory can be suggested. ([#16846])

# Notes for plugin developers [[toc](#table-of-contents)]

### Allow saving `CustomValue`s ([#16692]) [[toc](#table-of-contents)]

`CustomValue` now supports a `save` method. Implementors can use it to make their values savable to disk.

### Pass optional and casing to follow path methods for `CustomValue` ([#16736]) [[toc](#table-of-contents)]

Plugin authors that use `CustomValue` can now access the `optional` and `casing` fields in their `follow_path_int` and `follow_path_string` methods to add behavior for optional access or case sensitivity.

::: warning

This is a breaking change for the plugin signature so it needs an update. Simply ignoring these fields may be a valid solution.
