# Highlights and themes of this release [[toc](#table-of-contents)]

## Support for Background Jobs [[toc](#table-of-contents)]

Thanks to [@cosineblast](https://github.com/cosineblast) in [#14883](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/14883),
Nushell now has long awaited support for background jobs!

The following commands have been added to all platforms:

- `job spawn`
- `job list`
- `job kill`

And on Unix platforms:

- <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Z</kbd> to move a currently running external command into a frozen background job
- `job unfreeze`

Job support is considered "experimental" at the moment. We do expect that this feature will be enhanced
in the near future and that some functionality will change, likely with breaking changes.

## Official `.deb`, `.rpm`, and `.apk` packages are now available [[toc](#table-of-contents)]

Over in our Integrations repository, [PR #5](https://github.com/nushell/integrations/pull/5) adds official support
for Debian/Ubuntu (`.deb`), Red Hat/Fedora/Rocky (`.rpm`), and Alpine (`.apk`). See the [Installation Guide](https://www.nushell.sh/book/installation.html#package-managers)
for details.

## Custom Command Attributes [[toc](#table-of-contents)]

With [#14906](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/14906), attributes can now be attached to custom commands.
This release includes two built-in attributes:

- `@example`: Adds an example usage for the command.
- `@search-terms`: Adds search terms that can help users discover the command with `help --find` (or `help -f`).

Users can add their own attributes which will be available in the structured-data documentation accessible via
`help commands` and `scope commands`.

Also, the Standard Library and new `std-rfc` (below) have been updated to use Custom Attributes for
their examples. And the test harness has been updated to use a `@test` attribute to define test cases.

We expect that attributes will be used to enable additional features in future releases.

## `std-rfc` Module [[toc](#table-of-contents)]

The [Standard Library](https://www.nushell.sh/book/standard_library.html) (`std`) is a collection of
useful additions written in native Nu. [#15042](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/15042)
also adds `std-rfc`, a "proving ground" for proposed additions to the Standard Library. Features in
the `std-rfc` module should be considered experimental while we determine if and when they should be
promoted to the Standard Library in a future release. We welcome your feedback on these commands
to help us make that decision.

In this first release, `std-rfc` includes the following proposals:

- `std-rfc/conversions`: A set of helper conversions, including `into list`, `columns-into-table`, `name-values`,
  `record-into-columns`, and `table-into-columns`.
- `std-rfc/tables`: New commands to `select` and `reject` columns and rows based on slices, and a new `aggregate`
  command for running calculations on aggregated table data. `aggregate` is even more useful when paired with
  `group-by --to-table` results.
- `std-rfc/kv` (key-value store): a module which can easily store and retrieve pipeline (or other) data in an in-memory (session-based)
  or on-disk (universal) SQLite database. While we expect that Job control will be extended at some point
  with messaging support, `kv` can currently be used to retrieve results from a background job (and for many
  other purposes).
- `std-rfc/clip`: `clip copy` and `clip paste` commands for interacting with the system clipboard (requires
  terminal support).
- `std-rfc/str`: `dedent` and `unindent` commands to remove common (or specified) indentation from
  multi-line strings.
- `std-rfc/path`: Helpers for working with the extension, parent, or stem of a path.

## Completion and LSP enhancements [[toc](#table-of-contents)]

Thanks to PRs from [@blindFS](https://github.com/blindFS), this release includes quite a few LSP and completion fixes
and enhancements.

## Reedline Vi-mode enhancements [[toc](#table-of-contents)]

This release also includes a number of Vi-mode enhancements with additions to Reedline:

- From [@deephbz](https://github.com/deephbz)

  - Improvements to Visual Mode Selection and Command Consistency ([#867](https://github.com/nushell/reedline/pull/867))
  - Atomic unified commands for ChangeInside/DeleteInside ([#874](https://github.com/nushell/reedline/pull/874))
  - "Yank" (copy): ([#868](https://github.com/nushell/reedline/pull/868))

- From [@thomasschafer](https://github.com/thomasschafer)
  - <kbd>o</kbd> command to swap anchor and cursor ([#877](https://github.com/nushell/reedline/pull/877))
  - Clear selection when exiting visual mode ([#878](https://github.com/nushell/reedline/pull/878))

# Changes [[toc](#table-of-contents)]

## Additions [[toc](#table-of-contents)]

### `attr` commands [[toc](#table-of-contents)]

As part of the [new custom command attributes](#custom-command-attributes) introduced in this release, several attribute commands have been added:

- `attr example`: Attach an example to a command's help text.
  ```nu
  @example "double an int"  { 5 | double }   --result 10
  @example "double a float" { 0.5 | double } --result 1.0
  def double []: [number -> number] {
    $in * 2
  }
  # The examples above will be shown in `help double` or `double --help`.
  ```
- `attr search-terms`: Attach search terms to a command so that it is easier to find using `help --find`.
- `attr category`: Set the command category for a command.

### `random uuid` [[toc](#table-of-contents)]

Thanks to [@ayamdobhal](https://github.com/ayamdobhal) in [#15239](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/15239), the `random uuid` command can now also generate v1, v3, v5, and v7 uuids. Previously, only v4 uuids could be generated. To specify the version, pass the `-v`/`--version` flag (default is v4). Note that version 1 requires an additional `--mac`/`-m` flag to be provided, and versions 3 and 5 require both a `--namespace`/`-n` flag and a `--name`/`-s` flag.

### `default --empty` [[toc](#table-of-contents)]

This release introduces a new `--empty` flag for the `default` command ([#15223](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/15223)). With this new flag, if the input value is "empty", then the provided default value will be returned. A value is considering "empty" according to the `is-empty` command, which currently returns true for any of the following:

- an empty string: `""`
- an empty list: `[]`
- an empty record: `{}`
- an empty binary value: `0x[]`
- null: `null`

### Platform-specific `char eol` [[toc](#table-of-contents)]

In [#15059](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/15059), several additional escape characters were added to the `char` command:

- `eol`
- `lsep`
- `line_sep`

These will output the newline character(s) for the current platform (i.e., `\n` on Unix and `\r\n` on Windows). This is different from `newline`, `nl`, `line_feed`, and `lf` which all output `\n` on all platforms.

### `into string --group-digits` [[toc](#table-of-contents)]

With [#15265](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/15265), providing the `--group-digits` flag to the `into string` command will format integers by grouping several digits together and using the system locale digit separator.

### `from xml --allow-dtd` [[toc](#table-of-contents)]

After [#15272](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/15272), document type declarations (DTD) can now parsed by `from xml` if you pass the new `--allow-dtd` flag.

### `to yml` [[toc](#table-of-contents)]

As pointed out in [#15240](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/issues/15240), it was previously possible to load data from YAML files using the `from yaml` or `from yml` commands, but only possible to save data using `to yaml`. Now, you can use either `to yaml` or `to yml` to save data into YAML files thanks to [@LoicRiegel](https://github.com/LoicRiegel) in [#15254](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/15254).

```nu
> [[foo bar]; ["1" "2"]] | to yml
- foo: '1'
  bar: '2'
```

Thanks to this, the `save` command can also be used with the `.yml` extension:

```nu
> [[foo bar]; ["1" "2"]] | save test.yml
```

### `overlay use` completions [[toc](#table-of-contents)]

Thanks to [@hongquan](https://github.com/hongquan) in [#15057](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/15057) with input from [@blindFS](https://github.com/blindFS), autocomplete now lists more directories for `overlay use`.

### `$env.config.filesize.show_unit` [[toc](#table-of-contents)]

A new config option, `$env.config.filesize.show_unit`, was introduced in [#15276](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/15276). `show_unit` is `true` by default, but when it is set to `false`, file sizes will be displayed without units (e.g., in `table`). This can be useful if you have set `filesize.unit` to a fixed unit, and you do not want the same unit to be shown over and over again.

### Backtraces for Nushell code [[toc](#table-of-contents)]

Some errors in Nushell code can be "chained", where one error condition creates another (and potentially another).

Previously, it could be difficult to find the source of the actual error, but with
[#14945](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/14945), it is now possible to enable backtraces in Nushell
code. To do so:

```nu
$env.NU_BACKTRACE = 1
```

... and re-run the failing code.

### Startup banner theming [[toc](#table-of-contents)]

With [#15095](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/15095), it is now possible to set the styles used
in the Welcome banner at startup using new `$env.config.color_config` settings:

- `banner_foreground`: The primary color of the banner text
- `banner_highlight1`: Used for the first set of highlights, e.g., `Nushell`, `nu`, `GitHub`, et. al
- `banner_highlight2`: Used for the second set of highlights, e.g. `Discord`, `Documentation`, et. al.

### Numeric range padding support in `str expand` [[toc](#table-of-contents)]

With [#15125](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/15125), [@atahabaki](https://github.com/atahabaki) added
support for numeric ranges with padded zeros in `str expand`. For example:

```nu
'{00..10}' | str expand
```

## Breaking changes [[toc](#table-of-contents)]

### `split list` now keeps empty sublists [[toc](#table-of-contents)]

In [#15161](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/15161),
if `split list` is used on a list with consecutive separators, it now returns an empty list. For example:

```nu
[1 1 0 0 3 3 0 4 4] | split list 0
# => [[1 1] [] [2 2] [3 3]]
```

### `match` no longer executes closures as if they were a block [[toc](#table-of-contents)]

Prior to [#15032](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/15032), `match` would attempt to execute a
closure returned from a match arm. Now, it returns the closure instead. For example:

Before #15032:

```nushell
match 1 { _ => {|| print hi} }
# => hi
```

After #15032:

```nushell
match 1 { _ => {|| print hi} }
# => closure_1090
```

### `PROMPT_*` environment variables are no longer inherited [[toc](#table-of-contents)]

With [#15130](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/15130), the `PROMPT_*` environments are no longer
inherited from the calling process. This prevents issues where some systems would set a POSIX-compatible `PROMPT_COMMAND`.

If a prompt setting is not defined in the startup config, a Nushell-compatible default is applied instead
of allowing inheritance from the parent process.

### Closure serialization changes [[toc](#table-of-contents)]

Prior to [#15285](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/15285), `to json`, `to msgpack`, and `to msgpackz` would serialize
closures as a `null`. With this PR, these commands are aligned with the existing behavior of `to nuon`. Attempting to pass a closure
(or data structure containing a closure) to one of these commands will result in an error. Instead, you can now use the `to <format> --serialize`
option with all of these commands, in which case a string-representation of the closure will be serialized.

### Filesize unit formatting [[toc](#table-of-contents)]

When setting a specific filesize unit via `$env.config.filesize.unit`, sizes will now be formatted using the default locale (e.g., separators and decimals). This returns a similar 0.98 behavior.

## Removals [[toc](#table-of-contents)]

### `range` [[toc](#table-of-contents)]

The `range` command has been removed in [#15038](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/15038) following it's [deprecation](https://www.nushell.sh/blog/2025-02-04-nushell_0_102_0.html#range-toc) in 0.102.0. Please use the `slice` command as one-to-one replacement.

### `into bits` [[toc](#table-of-contents)]

The `into bits` command has been removed in [#15039](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/15039) following it's [deprecation](https://www.nushell.sh/blog/2025-02-04-nushell_0_102_0.html#into-bits-toc) in 0.102.0. Please use the `format bits` command as one-to-one replacement.

### `fmt` [[toc](#table-of-contents)]

The `fmt` command has been removed in [#15040](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/15040) following it's [deprecation](https://www.nushell.sh/blog/2025-02-04-nushell_0_102_0.html#fmt-toc) in 0.102.0. Please use the `format number` command as one-to-one replacement.

    - A user-facing change. These PRs should go into the `# Changes` section.
    - A plugin-facing change. These PRs should go in `# Notes for plugin developers`. Some plugin-facing changes might also be a user-facing change and vice versa.
    - A documentation improvement, error message improvement, refactoring PR, clippy fix, typo fix, etc. These PRs go into the `# Hall of fame`. You can just copy the table row in this section and paste it to the `# Hall of fame` section above. Note that major refactorings may warrant a section in `# Highlights`.
    - Dependabot PRs and version bumps should be ignored. They will only be mentioned in `# Full changelog`.
