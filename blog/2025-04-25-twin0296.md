### Published 2025-04-29, with PR Updates through 2025-04-25

## Highlights

- Ack! I'm late; I'm late! TWiN #296 apologies for this week's delay. Something about a dog, homework, and a giant bouncy house?
- Wow - @Kissaki did some awesome work in `nu_scripts` with _15 PRs_! Thank you!
- Another new Polars command joins the team courtesy of @MMesch â€” `polars join_where`.
  Did you know that brings us to a total of _three_ SQL-like `join` commands in Nushell?
- Job control continues to progress with @cosineblast's addition of tags! And as a sneak preview, there's a special
  job-control surprise in store that just missed the cutoff for this week's TWiN. You can read all about it in ...
