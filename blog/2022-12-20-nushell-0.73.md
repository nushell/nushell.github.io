# Nushell 0.73

Nushell, or Nu for short, is a new shell that takes a modern, structured approach to your command line. It works seamlessly with the data from your filesystem, operating system, and a growing number of file formats to make it easy to build powerful command line pipelines.

Today, we're releasing version 0.73 of Nu. This release includes new math commands, an interactive data viewer, and many command refinements.

<!-- more -->

# Where to get it

Nu 0.73 is available as [pre-built binaries](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/releases/tag/0.73.0) or from [crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/nu). If you have Rust installed you can install it using `cargo install nu`.

NOTE: The optional dataframe functionality is available by `cargo install nu --features=dataframe`.

As part of this release, we also publish a set of optional plugins you can install and use with Nu. To install, use `cargo install nu_plugin_<plugin name>`.

# Themes of this release / New features

## PLEASE NOTE: Boolean `&&` and `||` have changed

The boolean `&&` is now `and` and the boolean `||` is now `or`. These were deprecated in the 0.72 release and have now been removed. Existing scripts will need to be updated to the new syntax to run in 0.73.

## Experimental interactive `explore` command ([zhiburt](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/6984))

![Explore try mode](../assets/images/0_73_explore_try_mode.png)

This release includes a new experimental command called `explore` for viewing Nu data in an interactive UI. Some things to try:

- pipe a large table to `explore` (ex: `ls | explore`) and use `explore` as a fancy pager
- run `explore`, then type `:try` and press the Enter key to enter a mode where you can run commands inside `explore`

`explore` is highly experimental and we expect it to change in the future. [Please report any issues you discover](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/issues/new/choose).

## New `math` commands ([sholderbach](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/7258))

With this release we include a larger number of `math` commands for real valued math such as trigonometric functions and logarithms.
The goal is to remove the `math eval` command that operates on strings instead of proper nushell expressions.

### Constants

- `math pi`
- `math tau`
- `math e`

### Trigonometry and hyperbolic functions

- `math sin`
- `math cos`
- `math tan`
- `math sinh`
- `math cosh`
- `math tanh`
- `math arcsin`
- `math arccos`
- `math arctan`
- `math arcsinh`
- `math arccosh`
- `math arctanh`

### Logarithms

- `math log`
- `math ln`

```nu
〉math pi | math cos
-1
〉math e | math ln
1
〉[16 8 4 2] | math log 2
[4 3 2 1]
```

## Changes to commands with predicates ([kubouch](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/7428))

`any`, `all`, `skip until`, `skip while`, `take until`, and `take while` now accept a closure instead of a row condition. For example

```nu
[[status]; [UP] [UP]] | all status == UP
```

becomes

```nu
[[status]; [UP] [UP]] | all {|el| $el.status == UP }
```

This makes them slightly more verbose but it is a part of an effort to refactor our parser to allow defining concrete grammar rules for the Nu language. Row condition is currently accepted only in the `where` command which becomes a parser built-in command (like `use` or `let`).

## New `filter` command and simpler `where` ([kubouch](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/7365))

We found the `-b` flag of `where` quite confusing and decided to remove it in favor of a new `filter` command. Both `filter` and `where` have similar functionality but `where` now only accepts a row condition and `filter` accepts a closure. Before:

```nu
[{a: 1} {a: 2}] | where -b {|x| $x.a > 1}
```

After:

```nu
[{a: 1} {a: 2}] | filter {|x| $x.a > 1}
```

Why is it useful to have two commands doing the same thing? Because with the `filter` command, you can store the closure in a variable:

```nu
let cond = {|x| $x.a > 1}
[{a: 1} {a: 2}] | filter $cond
```

On the other hand, `where` is more concise (`[{a: 1} {a: 2}] | where a > 1`) but you can't store its condition in a variable. The choice is yours!

## New command `uniq-by` ([raccmonteiro](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/7295))

To complement `uniq` which can identify unique or duplicated values in a collection or report the number of occurrences for a particular entry, we now have `uniq-by`.
It supports filtering a table by entries appearing in a particular column.

```nu
〉 [[fruit day]; [apple monday] [apple friday] [Apple friday] [apple monday] [pear monday] [orange tuesday]] | uniq-by fruit
╭───┬────────┬─────────╮
│ # │ fruit  │   day   │
├───┼────────┼─────────┤
│ 0 │ apple  │ monday  │
│ 1 │ Apple  │ friday  │
│ 2 │ pear   │ monday  │
│ 3 │ orange │ tuesday │
╰───┴────────┴─────────╯
```

## Mutable data structures can now have their inner values mutated using `=` ([webbedspace](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/7318))

If a variable has been defined as mutable using the recently-added `mut` keyword, you can now deeply mutate its inner values using `=`.

```nu
〉 mut a = { b: 1 }
〉 $a.b = 2
〉 $a.c = 3
〉 $a | to nuon
{b: 2, c: 3}
```

This syntax enhancement was added primarily to make modifying `$env.config` during a normal session much easier. Now, `$env.config` is considered inherently mutable. You can change a single config value like so:

```nu
$env.config.table.mode = compact_double
```

...and it will remain in effect for the rest of the session.

## More sophisticated coloring of data values using closures ([webbedspace](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/7141))

The `color_config` config record has new functionality: instead of specifying a single color name for all values of a given type, you may now alternatively provide a closure that dynamically computes a color for each individual value. The closure takes, as input, a single value of the given type, and must produce either a string value representing a color, or a `{ fg, bg, attr }` record (the same as what `color_config` already accepts as a color value). This feature can be used to provide important visual distinctions between ranges of values in data.

Here are some examples.

```nu
filesize: {|e|
	if $e == 0b { 'dark_gray'
	} else if $e < 1mb { 'cyan_bold'
	} else { 'blue_bold' }
}
```

This causes all filesize values to be colored using `dark_gray` if they equal `0b`, `cyan_bold` if they are less than `1mb`, and `blue_bold` otherwise. This means that, in `ls` output, empty files can be more easily distinguished from non-empty ones.

```nu
bool: { if $in { 'light_cyan' } else { 'light_gray' } }
```

This colors `true` in `light_cyan`, and `false` in `light_gray`. This can be useful when browsing a large table of booleans.

The themes in the default `config.nu` file have been updated with further examples of these closures.

In certain situations (most notably, during a single `ls` call that isn't piped to anything else) Nushell will parallelize the execution of these closures. As such, you cannot expect that they will run in the same order as each value appears in the output data.

:::warning
Currently, closures are only supported for output values - they do not work with color settings that begin with `shape_`, such as `shape_literal`. They also do not work with the color configuration for the new `explore` command. Only values inside of tables are highlighted using closures.
:::

## RISC V binary release

Starting with 0.73, Nushell now provides a RISC V for Linux as part of the set of release binaries.

# Breaking changes

- `save` no longer overwrites files by default, you must use the new `-f`/`--force` flag to overwrite an existing file ([#7262](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/7262))
- `split row` command will retain an empty string if the split string is empty. ([#7413](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/7413))
- `split list` now properly removes the separator in all positions ([#7355](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/7355))
- [The `--show-created-paths` flag has been replaced by `--verbose` from `mkdir`](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/7462).
- `fetch`: the `--output`, `--bin`, `--append` flags have been removed, use `fetch` with `save` to save fetched page to a file. ([#7468](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/7468))
- changes to how `get` works with deep cell paths ([#7480](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/7497))
- `mkdir`'s `-s`/`--show-created-paths` has been renamed to `-v`/`--verbose` for better consistency ([#7462](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/7462))
- `&&` is now `and` and `||` is now `or`
- `any`, `all`, `skip until`, `skip while`, `take until`, `take while` now take only a closure as an argument.
- `where` now takes only row condition argument, the `-b` flag has been removed (use `filter` instead of `where -b`).
