# Nushell 0.71

Nushell, or Nu for short, is a new shell that takes a modern, structured approach to your commandline. It works seamlessly with the data from your filesystem, operating system, and a growing number of file formats to make it easy to build powerful commandline pipelines.

Today, we're releasing version 0.71 of Nu. This release includes lots of overall polish.

<!-- more -->

# Where to get it

Nu 0.71 is available as [pre-built binaries](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/releases/tag/0.71.0) or from [crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/nu). If you have Rust installed you can install it using `cargo install nu`.

If you want all the built-in goodies, such as support for dataframes and SQLite databases, you can install it via `cargo install nu --features=extra`.

As part of this release, we also publish a set of optional plugins you can install and use with Nu. To install, use `cargo install nu_plugin_<plugin name>`.

# Themes of this release

## New `++` operator as a short-hand to append to lists (merelymyself)
https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/6766



## General consistency accross commands and types has improved:
### More iterating filter commands now support the `$in` variable consistently (webbedspace)
https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/6951
### `List`s finally support `upsert` (fdncred)
https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/6932
### `merge` can now also operate on records (webbedspace)
https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/6919
### `str substring` now also takes ranges (rgwood)
https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/6867
### `from` and `to` now show help info (rgwood)
https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/6856

## The position of the right prompt can now be customized ([nibon7](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/6781))

Previously the right prompt appeared only on the same line where the user input started. Now you can choose to place the right prompt part on the last line of user input.
This feature is not enabled by default, you can enable it using the `config nu` command to modify the config.nu file, just set `render_right_prompt_on_last_line` to true:

```
let-env config {
  render_right_prompt_on_last_line : true
  ...
}
```

* disabled

## How nushell outputs values can now be customized via `display_output` hook ([PerBothner](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/6915))

This new (somewhat experimental)  hook is useful for modifying how values are printed or diverting the output to a different window. This could be an IDE or "notebook" interface that can handle "rich output" such as HTML.
See [this section of the book](https://www.nushell.sh/book/hooks.html#basic-hooks#filtering-or-diverting-command-output).

A motivating example was to use inline HTML in [the DomTerm terminal emulator](https://domterm.org).
```let-env config = ($env.config | upsert hooks {
    if "DOMTERM" in (env).name {{
        display_output: { to html --partial --no-color | domterm hcat  }
    }} else {{ }}
```

The screenshot shows the output from the `du` and `ls Make*` commands. The first table is mostly scrolled out, but the the header is shifted so as to keep it visible.

## Updated PR Review Process

Recently, we have been fortunate to see a rise in submitted pull requests (PRs) and we are super grateful for this growing desire to improve Nushell.
Unfortunately, in some cases, a well intended PR does not match the direction Nushell is going and we are forced to close it which leads to wasted time of both the developer and the PR reviewer.
To hopefully prevent this from happening in the future, we kindly ask potential contributors to first reach out to us before making a substantial change to Nushell, especially if the change will affect user experience.
We updated our [contributing guide](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) as well as the PR template to reflect this policy.
To summarize:
1. You want to make some change to Nushell that is more involved than simple bug-fixing.
2. Go to [Discord](https://discordapp.com/invite/NtAbbGn) or a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/issues/new/choose) and chat with some core team members and/or other contributors about it.
3. After getting a green light from the core team, implement the feature, open a pull request (PR) and write a concise but comprehensive description of the change.
4. If your PR includes any use-facing features (such as adding a flag to a command), clearly list them in the PR description.
5. Then, core team members and other regular contributors will review the PR and suggest changes.
6. When we all agree, the PR will be merged.
7. If your PR includes any user-facing features, make sure the changes are also reflected in [the documentation](https://github.com/nushell/nushell.github.io) after the PR is merged.
8. Congratulate yourself, you just improved Nushell! :-)

We hope the new policy will help us make the PR review process smoother.

# Breaking changes

- New `--force (-f)` flag for the `mv` command. This change alters `mv` default behavior. By default overwriting existing files is now prevented (You can use `alias mv = mv -f` in you config to get the old defaults back). ([#6904](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/6904))
- The column name for the command name in `$nu.scope.commands` has been changed from `command` to `name`. Thus, `$nu.scope.commands | where name =~ zip` would give you specific command info. ([#7007](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/7007))
- The `str distance` command now directly returns an `Int` instead of a record `{"distance": <Int>}` ([#6963](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/6963))
- The argument order of `format filesize` was made consistent with other commands that accept a `CellPath` to specify fields that should be affected by it. Now the string specifying the format is the first positional argument and the cell path is specified in the following positional argument(s). ([#6879]https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/6879)
- The `--perf` flag for Nu was removed as part of an effort to simplify diagnostics logging [#6834](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/6834)

- @dandavison completion defaults

# Next Steps

We're continuing to work on language updates and hope to have more information for you soon. If you'd like to become part of the effort, please [join the discord](https://discord.gg/NtAbbGn).
