## Bug fixes [[toc](#table-of-contents)]

### Fix `http get` domain overflow [[toc](#table-of-contents)]

The dns resolution #17030 implemented in v0.109.0 for `http get` could overflow an array for domains with a lot of resolved IPs. This is fixed now by truncating the resolved IP amount.

### Fix path resolution for `source` using bare-word-string-interpolation [[toc](#table-of-contents)]

Fixed a regression in v0.109.0 that disallowed using patterns like:

```nu
  source config/($nu.os-info.name).nu
```
