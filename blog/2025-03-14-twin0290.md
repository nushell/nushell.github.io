# This week in Nushell #290

## Highlights

Be on the lookout for a new release! Nushell 0.103 is just around the corner, with an expected drop sometime around
Tuesday. That is, of course, when most folks get to try out all of the great stuff you've been reading about in TWiN for
the last month or so. But not you, right? You couldn't wait to try out job support, so you started running nightlies or
building yourself, right?!

This week we have a few new features, with more Polars PRs, a `default --empty` flag, and `into string --group-digits` as well!
