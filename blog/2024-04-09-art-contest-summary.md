# Art Contest Summary

Some time ago, we announced Nushell [logo and mascot contest](2023-12-21-logo-contest.md). We (the core team) agreed that we were not ready to commit to any of the submitted designs and begin using them as our official logo. Nevertherless, since the submissions are great, we wanted to collect and showcase them as a shoutout to the talented contributors.

Uli Troyo went completely overboard and created a [whole webpage](https://ulitroyo.github.io/nushell-ellie) for the mascot! You can choose themes for the shellefant, very cool! Here is one also with a logo and an icon matching the theme:
