# Changes

## Breaking changes

### Add name and description to the plugin list command
The `plugin list` command now adds an inline table containing the plugin commands names and descriptions.

## Additions

### Add `explore regex` command
The new `explore regex` command is meant to provide a TUI for exploring regular expressions and visualizing the results in real time. You can pipe text into the command and that text becomes the "test string" that the regular expressions run on. You can also start it up without piping anything into it and manually type the "test string" and then the regex. You can use the tab key to switch between panes. The arrow keys work to navigate as we as the page up and page down keys, home, and end.

### Other additions

* All `http` commands now support connecting via Unix domain sockets using the `--unix-socket` (or `-U`) flag, enabling communication with local services like Docker daemon, systemd, and other IPC services. ([#16907](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/16907))

* * `str replace` now accepts a closure that computes the replacement value for each match ([#16854](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/16854))
## Other changes

* add a --dry flag to mktemp. Edit or respond to this thread with what should go on this line ([#17039](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/17039))
## Bug fixes

### Better errors for dynamic `http` commands

Defining an HTTP command dynamically using a string for the method used to cause an unclear, uncategorized error. It now produces a clear and specific error message instead.

```nu
let method = "get"; http $method example.com
# => Error: nu::shell::error
# => 
# =>   × Invalid command construction
# =>    ╭─[entry #5:1:26]
# =>  1 │ let method = "get"; http $method example.com
# =>    ·                          ───┬───
# =>    ·                             ╰── Using "get" dynamically is bad command construction
# =>    ╰────
# =>   help: Prefer to use `http get` directly
  ```

```

</details>

### Allow streaming to commands with union-typed pipeline input
Commands whose input signatures are declared with `oneof` now accept
streams instead of erroring:

```
> def f []: [oneof<list> -> nothing] {}
> [] | each {} | f
Error: nu::shell::only_supports_this_input_type

  × Input type not supported.
   ╭─[entry #2:1:6]
 1 │ [] | each {} | f
   ·      ──┬─      ┬
   ·        │       ╰── only oneof<list<any>> input data is supported
   ·        ╰── input type: list<any>
```

### Fix(`split column`): switch to 0-index like other commands
Like `detect columns` or `parse`, `split column` now also uses 0-index for the default column names.

### Don't error on optional cellpaths
Now, when you specify an optional cellpath in `update`, it won't error if it is not present.
```nu
> {a: 1} | update b? 2
 a | 1
```

### Other fixes

* Fixed the new operators `not-starts-with` and `not-ends-with` not appearing in `help operators` ([#16873](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/16873))

* Fixed a bug in completion matcher where `foo "b<tab>` doesn't match `"bar baz"`. ([#16869](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/16869))

* Fixed a bug in flattening aliased external calls. ([#16876](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/16876))

* Fixed a bug of wrong argument order when calling `$env.config.buffer_editor` from `config nu`. ([#16877](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/16877))

* Fixed an issue where plugins built without the `nu-protocol/sqlite` feature would fail to load if `$env.config.history.file_format` was set to `"sqlite"`. ([#16890](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/16890))

* Fixed the output type of `version check` to be `record` instead of `string`. ([#16893](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/16893))

* Fixed a bug in aliased external command completion where `alias ea = ^$env.EDITOR /tmp/test.s; e<tab>` gets empty result. ([#16882](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/16882))

* Fixes a regression that causes absolute paths to be required when opening files with the polars plugin. ([#16900](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/16900))

* The `which` command now filters files found in `$PATH` to include only executables. ([#16895](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/16895))

* Fixed a regression of custom-completion for short flags without a long name. ([#16967](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/16967))

* This PR fixes the "polars slice" command so that it will return a lazyframe output when given a lazyframe as input. Fixes #17065 ([#17067](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/17067))
