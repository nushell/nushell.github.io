# Nushell 0.106.1

Today, we're releasing version 0.106.1 of Nu. This patch release fixes a regression with bare string interpolation from 0.106.0, the const version of `get`, and several build-related issues.

# Where to get it

Nu 0.106.1 is available as [pre-built binaries](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/releases/tag/0.106.1) or from [crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/nu). If you have Rust installed you can install it using `cargo install nu`.

As part of this release, we also publish a set of optional [plugins](https://www.nushell.sh/book/plugins.html) you can install and use with Nushell.

# Changes

## Bug fixes and other changes

### Fixed regression in the bare string interpolation [#16235]
While fixing another parser bug in 0.106.0 we accidentally introduced a [regression which restricted certain forms of direct string interpolation using parenthesized expressions with bare words](https://www.nushell.sh/blog/2025-07-23-nushell_0_106_0.html#regression-bare-word-interpolation-on-both-sides-does-not-work-toc).
Thanks to a fix by @[Bahex] the following form of string interpolation again works without issue:

```nushell
let x = 123
($x)/foo/($x)
# => 123/foo/123
```

### Fixed flag handling of `get` in the const version [#16268]
The recent change to [`get` to rename `--ignore-errors` to `--optional`](https://www.nushell.sh/blog/2025-07-23-nushell_0_106_0.html#ignore-errors-i-renamed-to-optional-o-toc) was incorrectly handled if the command was used in a `const` context. This has been fixed with this release.

### Fix for builds on NetBSD and FreeBSD
BSD builds failed due to more restrictive Rust compiler warnings triggered in our BSD platform code. This has been fixed in [#16266] and [#16275] by @[0323pin] and @[sholderbach]

### Fixed warnings for plugin builds
When building plugins with our Rust `nu-plugin-core 0.106.0` crate you may have encountered compiler warnings. This has been addressed by @[cptpiepmatz] in [#16279]
