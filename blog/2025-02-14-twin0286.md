# This Week in Nushell #286

Published Friday, 2025-02-14

## Highlights

Some exciting changes this week in `main` and nightlies include the first drop of a new Custom Attributes feature - Thanks @Bahex!
This has been a much anticpiated (and discussed) feature. Attributes can now be defined and assigned to custom commands.
Custom Attributes are currently being used to attach nicely-formatted examples to the custom commands in the Standard Library (`std`),
define test cases for the those commands, and even assign new search terms to the help. And there's more to come!

In addition, `std-rfc` has been moved into Nushell-proper (and updated with custom attributes as well). These "early look"/preview
commands can now be used out-of-the-box with `use std-rfc/<submodule>`.

And those who have already wasted far too much time theming their shell can now also custom-theme the Welcome Banner.
