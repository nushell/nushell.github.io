# This Week in Nushell #285

Posted Friday, 2025-02-07.

## Highlights

Since this was a release-week, a number of the changes below are included in the **[0.102.0 release](/blog/2025-02-04-nushell_0_102_0.html)**, a few were housekeeping tasks related
to the release, and some items will, of course, appear in nightly builds and `main` (and eventually 0.103).

A belated thanks to **[@0x4D5352](https://github.com/0x4D5352)** for bringing much-needed consistency to the documentation. With output now commented out in code blocks, you can copy examples directly from the docs and paste them into Nushell.

In case you missed it, in December **[@ayax79](https://github.com/ayax79)** added `polars open` support for Amazon S3 in
[#14648](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/14648) and followed up this week with `polars save` to S3 in [#15005](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/15005)!

And **[WindSoilder](https://github.com/WindSoilder)** made it easier to debug Nushell errors with a new backtrace feature ([#14945](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/14945)).
