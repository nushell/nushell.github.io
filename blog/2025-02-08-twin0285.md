# This week in Nushell #285

Posted Friday, 2025-02-07.

## Highlights

This being a release-week, we had a number of changes that went into the 0.102.0 release,
some housekeeping items related to the 0.102.0 release, and a few other changes that will
make their appearance in Nightly builds and `main`.

First a belated thanks to [0x4D5352](https://github.com/0x4D5352) for bringing some much-needed consistency to the documentation. With the output commented-out
in code-blocks, you should now be able to copy examples from the doc and paste directly into Nushell.

Also, in case you missed it earlier, [ayax79](https://github.com/ayax79)'s PR [#14684](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/14648)
added `polars open` support for Amazon S3. This week's [#15005](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/15005) builds on that with `polars save` to S3 as well!
