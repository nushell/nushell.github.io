## One `where` to rule them all [[toc](#table-of-contents)]

`where` used to support only row conditions and literal closures for filtering rows.
If you wanted to use stored closures, you had to use `filter`.

In [#15697](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/15697), [@Bahex](https://github.com/Bahex) added stored closure support to `where`, making `filter` obsolete. Because of this, `filter` was marked deprecated in [#15867](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/15867).
[@132ikl](https://github.com/132ikl) updated the docs accordingly in [#15467](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/15467).

Now, `where` can be used as a drop-in replacement for `filter`.

## Better deprecations [[toc](#table-of-contents)]

You can now use the `@deprecated` attribute on custom commands to mark them as deprecated, thanks to [@132ikl](https://github.com/132ikl) in [#15770](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/15770). Pass a string as the first argument to show a custom deprecation message. You can also add flags to give more details:

- `--flag`: mark a flag as deprecated
- `--since`: specify when the deprecation started
- `--remove`: indicate when this command or flag will be removed
- `--report`: use `"first"` or `"every"` to control how often users see the warning

For example:

```nu
@deprecated "Use my-new-command instead."
@category deprecated
def my-old-command [] {}
```

## `oneof` the things [[toc](#table-of-contents)]

Built-in commands have long used `SyntaxShape::OneOf` to accept multiple possible types.
Custom commands couldn't do this until [#15646](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/15646), when [@Bahex](https://github.com/Bahex) added the `oneof<...>` type to declare type alternatives.

Example:

```nu
def foo [
    param: oneof<binary, string>
] { .. }
```

## Case-sensitive cell-paths or not`!` [[toc](#table-of-contents)]

Before, it wasn't clear if cell-paths were case-sensitive, so some commands expected case sensitivity while others didn't.
[@Bahex](https://github.com/Bahex) fixed this in [#15692](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/15692).

Now, all cell-paths are case-sensitive by default.
If you add a `!` after a path element, that element becomes case-insensitive.

For example, `foo.bar!.baz` matches:

* `foo.bar.baz`
* `foo.BAR.baz`
* `foo.BaR.baz`

but not:

* `FOO.bar.baz`
* `foo.BAR.BAZ`

The `--sensitive` and `--insensitive` flags still work but some are now deprecated.
`$env` remains a special record with always case-insensitive cell-paths.

You can also use the new syntax to say: get `"foo"` case-insensitively, or return nothing if not found: `get foo?!`.

## `recurse`'ively explore nested values [[toc](#table-of-contents)]

This release adds a new `recurse` command in `std-rfc/iter`, as an equivalent to jq's `recurse`/`..`.

It recursively descends its input and returns a stream of all "descendant" values, along with their cell-path relative to the input value.
It is especially useful for exploring and searching through deep trees.

```nu
{
    "foo": {
        "egg": "X"
        "spam": "Y"
    }
    "bar": {
        "quox": ["A" "B"]
    }
}
| recurse
| update item { to nuon }
# => ╭───┬──────────────┬───────────────────────────────────────────────╮
# => │ # │     path     │                     item                      │
# => ├───┼──────────────┼───────────────────────────────────────────────┤
# => │ 0 │ $.           │ {foo: {egg: X, spam: Y}, bar: {quox: [A, B]}} │
# => │ 1 │ $.foo        │ {egg: X, spam: Y}                             │
# => │ 2 │ $.bar        │ {quox: [A, B]}                                │
# => │ 3 │ $.foo.egg    │ "X"                                           │
# => │ 4 │ $.foo.spam   │ "Y"                                           │
# => │ 5 │ $.bar.quox   │ [A, B]                                        │
# => │ 6 │ $.bar.quox.0 │ "A"                                           │
# => │ 7 │ $.bar.quox.1 │ "B"                                           │
# => ╰───┴──────────────┴───────────────────────────────────────────────╯
```

`recurse` can also take a cell-path (or even a closure) to limit how it descends through its input, making it well suited to dealing with document formats like XML.
Here's an example using it to extract titles from the Nushell RSS feed:
```nu
http get 'https://www.nushell.sh/rss.xml'
| recurse content
| get item
| where ($it | describe -d).type == record and $it.tag? == title
| get content.content
| flatten
# => Nushell
# => This Week in Nushell #302
# => This Week in Nushell #301
# => Nushell 0.104.1
# => This Week in Nushell #300
# => This Week in Nushell #299
# => This Week in Nushell #298
# => This Week in Nushell #297
# => Nushell 0.104.0
# => This week in Nushell #296
```

## No more `openssl` [[toc](#table-of-contents)]

If you've built nushell on Linux, you probably had to install openssl libraries because we linked to it by default.
This version switches fully to [rustls](https://github.com/rustls/rustls), a pure Rust TLS library, making builds simpler.
The change was made by [@cptpiepmatz](https://github.com/cptpiepmatz) in [#15810](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/15810), and [#15812](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/15812) added support for older platforms.

If you still need openssl, build with `--no-default-features --features plugin,trash-support,sqlite,native-tls`.

## Better Windows releases [[toc](#table-of-contents)]

Thanks to [@hustcer](https://github.com/hustcer), our Windows releases are now much improved.
Check out the [Nushell 0.104.1 blog post](https://www.nushell.sh/blog/2025-05-23-nushell_0_104_1.html) for more details.

## HTTP by default [[toc](#table-of-contents)]

Running `http get example.com` used to fail because the command needed a full URL.
[@noahfraiture](https://github.com/noahfraiture) fixed this in [#15804](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/15804) by letting Nushell add `http://` when the scheme is missing.

Now you can write:
- `http get example.com`
- `http get :8000` goes to [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)

## More Polars [[toc](#table-of-contents)]

This release adds several new `polars` commands:

* `polars struct-encode-json` by [@ayax79](https://github.com/ayax79) in [#15678](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/15678)
* `polars horizontal` by [@pyz4](https://github.com/pyz4) in [#15656](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/15656)
* `polars replace` by [@pyz4](https://github.com/pyz4) in [#15706](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/15706)

Also, `polars first` now works with `polars group-by` thanks to [@ayax79](https://github.com/ayax79) in [#15855](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/15855).

Thanks to [@pyz4](https://github.com/pyz4), `polars unique` ([#15771](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/15771)), `polars shift` ([#15834](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/15834)), and `polars group-by --maintain-order` ([#15865](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/15865)) now accept expression inputs.

[@pyz4](https://github.com/pyz4) also added new `polars math` expressions in [#15822](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/15822).

# Changes [[toc](#table-of-contents)]

## Additions [[toc](#table-of-contents)]

### Ignore fields in simple `parse` patterns with `_` [[toc](#table-of-contents)]

[@132ikl](https://github.com/132ikl) added the option to use the placeholder `_` to ignore fields in [#15873](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/15873).

```nu
"hello world" | parse "{foo} {_}"
# => ╭───┬───────╮
# => │ # │  foo  │
# => ├───┼───────┤
# => │ 0 │ hello │
# => ╰───┴───────╯
```

### Lazy closure evaluation for `default` [[toc](#table-of-contents)]

`default` can now take a closure for a default value instead of a direct value thanks to [@Mrfiregem](https://github.com/Mrfiregem) in [#15654](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/15654).
These closure are lazily evaluated and cached.

```nu
ls | default { sleep 5sec; 'N/A' } name # => No-op since `name` column is never empty
ls | default { sleep 5sec; 'N/A' } foo bar # => creates columns `foo` and `bar`; only takes 5 seconds since closure result is cached
```

### `path join` can now read byte stream input [[toc](#table-of-contents)]

When commands return a path, thanks to [@Mrfiregem](https://github.com/Mrfiregem) in [#15736](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/15736), you can now call `path join` directly without having to use `collect`.

```nu
^pwd | path join foo
```

### `run-external` spreads command if it's a list [[toc](#table-of-contents)]

With the addition of [#15776](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/15776) by [@Mrfiregem](https://github.com/Mrfiregem), `run-external` (or calling an external) can now use a list to support arguments.

```nu
$env.config.buffer_editor = ["emacsclient", "-s", "light", "-t"]
run-external $env.config.buffer_editor foo.text
```

### Improvements to `bench` [[toc](#table-of-contents)]

[@Tyarel8](https://github.com/Tyarel8) added some improvements to `bench` in [#15843](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/15843) and [#15856](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/15856).
It is now possible to pass multiple closures into `bench` to compare and added the flags:
- `--warmup`
- `--setup`
- `--prepare`
- `--cleanup`
- `--conclude`
- `--ignore-errors`

### `overlay new -r` can now reset overlays [[toc](#table-of-contents)]

[@WindSoilder](https://github.com/WindSoilder) added the option to reset new overlays via `overlay new -r` in [#15849](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/15849).

### See env variables as externals would [[toc](#table-of-contents)]

In [#15875](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/15875) did [@cptpiepmatz](https://github.com/cptpiepmatz) add the command `debug env` to get a record of how an external would get the environment variables.
This includes handling the `$env.PATH` and all env conversions.

### Use PowerShell scripts from the `$env.PATH` [[toc](#table-of-contents)]

[@fdncred](https://github.com/fdncred) made it possible in [#15760](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/15760) to execute powershell scripts from anywhere if they are in the `$env.PATH`.

### Make your table look like they are from neovim [[toc](#table-of-contents)]

[@gmr458](https://github.com/gmr458) added the new table mode `"single"` to `$env.config.table.mode` in [#15672](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/15672).
It looks like the `"default"` with sharp corners or `"heavy"` with thinner lines:

```nu
$env.config.table.mode = "single"
scope commands | select name category | first 2
# => ┌───┬───────┬──────────┐
# => │ # │ name  │ category │
# => ├───┼───────┼──────────┤
# => │ 0 │ alias │ core     │
# => │ 1 │ all   │ filters  │
# => └───┴───────┴──────────┘
```

### Center columns via `to md --center` [[toc](#table-of-contents)]

[@lazenga](https://github.com/lazenga) added in [#15861](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/15861) the flag `--center` to `to md`.
With it you can pass a list of cell-paths to center in the markdown output.

```nu
version | select version build_time | transpose k v | to md --center [v] --pretty
# => | k          |             v              |
# => | ---------- |:--------------------------:|
# => | version    |          0.104.2           |
# => | build_time | 2025-06-08 23:31:40 +02:00 |
```

### Prefer OSC 9;9 on Windows over OSC 7 [[toc](#table-of-contents)]

[@ofek](https://github.com/ofek) made `$env.config.shell_integration.osc7 = false` by default on Windows in favor of `$env.config.shell_integration.osc9_9 = true` in [#15914](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/15914).

### Disable expensive calculations with `gstat --disable-tag` [[toc](#table-of-contents)]

In [#15893](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/15893) did [@snickerdoodle2](https://github.com/snickerdoodle2) add the option `--disable-tag` to disable some of the heavy calculations of the `gstat` plugin.

### Know what `open` and `save` can do with `std/help` [[toc](#table-of-contents)]

`open` and `save` can use `from` and `to` to convert data types.
With the addition of [@weirdan](https://github.com/weirdan) in [#15651](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/15651),
the `std/help` command can now show these conversions.

### Content type of `view span` [[toc](#table-of-contents)]

[@weirdan](https://github.com/weirdan) added in [#15842](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/15842) a content type to `view span`.
If your display hook highlights content types, will this be a nice addition.

## Breaking changes [[toc](#table-of-contents)]

### Cell-paths with case-sensitivity and without`!` [[toc](#table-of-contents)]

The new cell-path syntax `!`, introduced by [@Bahex](https://github.com/Bahex) in [#15692](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/15692), may break some commands.
If your commands relied on case-insensitive paths, please check your code.

### Paths on lazy frames now produce expressions [[toc](#table-of-contents)]

Thanks to [@ayax79](https://github.com/ayax79) in [#15891](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/15891), paths on lazy frames now generate expressions.
You will need to use `polar collect` to evaluate them.

# Notes for plugin developers [[toc](#table-of-contents)]

## Construct `IoError` from `std::io::Error` instead of `std::io::ErrorKind` [[toc](#table-of-contents)]

To give us better control over IO errors, [@cptpiepmatz](https://github.com/cptpiepmatz) changed in [#15777](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/15777) how `IoError`s are created. Now they’re built directly from `std::io::Error` instead of just the `ErrorKind`.
Just remove the calls to `.kind()` and you're good to go.
