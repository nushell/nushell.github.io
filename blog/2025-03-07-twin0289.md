# This Week in Nushell #289

Published Friday, March 7th, 2025

## Highlights

The Nushell repo reached 10,000 commits this week with the addition of an LSP fix by blindFS. Thank you again for the
steady stream of LSP and Treesitter improvements!

Congrats to the YAML family! `to yaml` welcomes new sibling `to yml` so that `save`ing files with either extension
works seamlessly. Thanks LoicReigel!

Thanks MMesch for multiple Polars PRs this week!

And **ayamdobhal** brings some great improvements to `random uuid` with the addition of 4 new UUID version implementations.
Thank you!
