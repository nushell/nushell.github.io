# This Week in Nushell #297

### Published 2025-05-03

## Highlights

A typical Nushell release week means fewer PRs in general, as we try to make sure things relatively stable. But this week, folks took
the opportunity to contribute to the _other_ Nushell repos in a big way:

- @pyz4's new `polars horizontal` command got merged after the release, so expect to see it in 0.105. Thanks!
- @Kissaki continues some awesome doc updates this week with _twenty_ PRs, including fixing a long-standing issue with Nushell tables not appearing correctly in Android browsers. Thank you!
- A belated thanks to @kiil in last week's PRs for adding something we don't see every day—"humlespring", a _game_ that demonstrates Nushell programming concepts!
- And whadda-ya-know, this week @0x4D5352 said, _"Well, just maybe we **should** see that everyday!"_ and added _another_ game—"nu-niversal paperclips". Sweet!
- Thanks to @gmr458 there's now a new table style—`single`. It's like `heavy`, but it's not!
- Ah, @zhiburt. Tables in Nushell just wouldn't be the same without you! Thanks again for your updates and work in this area!

- And finally, for all you neo-vimmers out there, a special request from @chuboe on Discord. An oldie-but-a-goodie from the Integrations repository—A sample [Neovim Nushell `init.lua`](https://github.com/nushell/integrations/tree/main/nvim).
  Those of you searching in all the wrong places for information on LSP, editor or IDE integration, or Nvim might finally get Google (or your non-monopolistic search engine of choice) to point you in the right direction.
