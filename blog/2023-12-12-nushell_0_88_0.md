# Nushell 0.88.0

Nushell, or Nu for short, is a new shell that takes a modern, structured approach to your command line. It works seamlessly with the data from your filesystem, operating system, and a growing number of file formats to make it easy to build powerful command line pipelines.

<!-- TODO: write this excerpt -->
Today, we're releasing version 0.88.0 of Nu. This release adds...

# Where to get it

Nu 0.88.0 is available as [pre-built binaries](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/releases/tag/0.88.0) or from [crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/nu). If you have Rust installed you can install it using `cargo install nu`.

::: tip Note
The optional dataframe functionality is available by `cargo install nu --features=dataframe`.
:::

As part of this release, we also publish a set of optional plugins you can install and use with Nu. To install, use `cargo install nu_plugin_<plugin name>`.

## Spread operator

[#10598](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/issues/10598) asked for a spread operator (`...`), and in [#11006](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/11006)
and [#11144](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/11144/), [@ysthakur](https://github.com/ysthakur/) implemented a spread operator in lists and records, respectively.
Spreading arguments to commands has not been implemented yet.

The spread operator can help you avoid `append` in lists, e.g., this:
```nushell
let list = ["foo"]
[
    1,
    ...$list,
    ...("foo" | split chars),
    ...[3 9],
    []
] | to nuon
```
will give:
```nushell
[1, foo, f, o, o, 3, 9, []]
```

In records, it can help you avoid `merge`, e.g., this:
```nushell
let record = { a: "foo" }
{
    ...$record,
    y: "bar",
    ...{ z: 2 }
} | to nuon
```
will give:
```nushell
{a: foo, y: bar, z: 2}
```

You can spread variables, subexpressions, and either lists (inside list literals) or records (inside record literals).
Note that there needs to be no whitespace between the `...` and the expression being spread.

## Our set of commands is evolving [[toc](#table-of-content)]
As usual, new release rhyms with changes to commands!

### New commands [[toc](#table-of-content)]

## stor

With this release we've implemented a new sqlite family of commands called `stor`. `stor` is meant to be short for "storing data in an in-memory sqlite database". That's right, this family of commands supports an _in-memory_ database. This in-memory database will be accessible as long as they share the same executable instance. A new instance is created with each new nushell instance and the in-memory database cannot be shared between instances. We're exited to see what new things you'll invent with this technology, although we still consider it in the experimental phase. Please feel free to submit PRs to make the usage of it better and more robust. There are examples of how to use each command [in the PR](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/11170).

Here the summary you get when you execute the `stor` command.
```nushell
Usage:
  > stor

Subcommands:
  stor create - Create a table in the in-memory sqlite database
  stor delete - Delete a table or specified rows in the in-memory sqlite database
  stor export - Export the in-memory sqlite database to a sqlite database file
  stor import - Import a sqlite database file into the in-memory sqlite database
  stor insert - Insert information into a specified table in the in-memory sqlite database
  stor open - Opens the in-memory sqlite database
  stor reset - Reset the in-memory database by dropping all tables
  stor update - Update information in a specified table in the in-memory sqlite database

Flags:
  -h, --help - Display the help message for this command

Input/output types:
  ╭─#─┬──input──┬─output─╮
  │ 0 │ nothing │ string │
  ╰───┴─────────┴────────╯

### Removed commands [[toc](#table-of-content)]

<!-- NOTE: to start investigating the contributions of last release, i like to list them all in a raw table.
    to achieve this, one can use the [`list-merged-prs` script from `nu_scripts`](https://github.com/nushell/nu_scripts/blob/main/make_release/release-note/list-merged-prs)
    as follows:

    ```nushell
    use ./make_release/release-note/list-merged-prs
    use std clip

    let last_release_date = ^gh api /repos/nushell/nushell/releases
        | from json
        | into datetime published_at
        | get published_at
        | sort
        | last

    let prs = list-merged-prs nushell/nushell $last_release_date
        | where author != "app/dependabot"
        | sort-by mergedAt
        | update url {|it| $"[#($it.number)]\(($it.url)\)" }
        | update author { $"[@($in)]\(https://github.com/($in)\)" }
        | select author title url
        | rename -c {url: pr}
        | to md --pretty

    $prs | to md --pretty | clip
    ```
