# Nushell 0.88.0

Nushell, or Nu for short, is a new shell that takes a modern, structured approach to your command line. It works seamlessly with the data from your filesystem, operating system, and a growing number of file formats to make it easy to build powerful command line pipelines.

<!-- TODO: write this excerpt -->
Today, we're releasing version 0.88.0 of Nu. This release adds...

# Where to get it

Nu 0.88.0 is available as [pre-built binaries](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/releases/tag/0.88.0) or from [crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/nu). If you have Rust installed you can install it using `cargo install nu`.

::: tip Note
The optional dataframe functionality is available by `cargo install nu --features=dataframe`.
:::

As part of this release, we also publish a set of optional plugins you can install and use with Nu. To install, use `cargo install nu_plugin_<plugin name>`.

## New _spread_ operator for list and record literals [[toc](#table-of-content)]

[#10598](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/issues/10598) asked for a spread operator (`...`), and in [#11006](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/11006)
and [#11144](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/11144/), [@ysthakur](https://github.com/ysthakur/) implemented a spread operator in lists and records, respectively.
Spreading arguments to commands has not been implemented yet.

The spread operator can help you avoid `append` in lists, e.g., this:
```nushell
let list = ["foo"]
[
    1,
    ...$list,
    ...("foo" | split chars),
    ...[3 9],
    []
] | to nuon
```
will give:
```nushell
[1, foo, f, o, o, 3, 9, []]
```

In records, it can help you avoid `merge`, e.g., this:
```nushell
let record = { a: "foo" }
{
    ...$record,
    y: "bar",
    ...{ z: 2 }
} | to nuon
```
will give:
```nushell
{a: foo, y: bar, z: 2}
```

You can spread variables, subexpressions, and either lists (inside list literals) or records (inside record literals).
Note that there needs to be no whitespace between the `...` and the expression being spread.

## Show found externals via syntax highlighting in the [REPL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read%E2%80%93eval%E2%80%93print_loop) [[toc](#table-of-content)]
We've added a new experimental feature that changes the syntax highlighting of text in the command position in the repl. Here's how it works. As you type, if a command is found with the current letter you've typed, the command will be highlighted according to your configuration of your color theme, specifically `shape_external_resolved`. As you keep typing, `which` fires to find out if the command is found or not. This allows you to know whether you've created a typo before you ever hit enter in the nushell repl.

Since this might have a performance impact, we've put this behind a configuration point named `highlight_resolved_externals` in the config.nu file. Set it to `true` to enable this functionality and `false` to disable it. It defaults to `false`.

Right now, with a dark theme, here's one way of configuring these colors, in the config.nu color theme, that showcases this funcitonality. Also, make sure you have `highlight_resolved_externals` set to `true`.

```nushell
  shape_internalcall: cyan_bold               # internal commands that are found will be this color
  shape_external: darkorange                  # external "commands" that do not exist, will be this color
  shape_external_resolved: light_yellow_bold  # external commands that are found with `which`, will be this color
```
You can read more about it and see a gif in [#11135](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/11135) where [@fdncred](https://github.com/fdncred) implemented the feature.

## Passing boolean switches dynamically [[toc](#table-of-content)]
In last release, a distinction has been introduced between switches, e.g. `--enable-feature`, and
boolean options, e.g. `--do-something: bool`.
The former is simply used as `--enable-feature` and the latter expects a value as
`--do-something false`.

Up until now, this had the downside of disallowing one to pass boolean switches to inner calls of
commands.
An example would be two commands, `foo` and `bar`, which both have a `--switch` and where `foo` is
calling `bar` internally with the opposite switch. It would have to look something like
```nushell
def bar [--switch] {
    print $"switch in bar: ($switch)"
}

def foo [--switch] {
    print $"switch in foo: ($switch)"
    if $switch {
        bar
    } else {
        bar --switch
    }
}
```
or `bar` would have to take a boolean value instead of a switch, which would make the command less
nice to use as part of a public API...
```nushell
def bar [--switch: bool] {
    print $"switch in bar: ($switch)"
}

def foo [--switch] {
    print $"switch in foo: ($switch)"
    bar --switch (not $switch)
}
```

In this release and thanks to the work of [@WindSoilder](https://github.com/WindSoilder) in
[#11057](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/11057), boolean switches can now be passed around.
This will simplify the code above and still preserve the nice signature of `bar` :partying:
```nushell
def bar [--switch] {
    print $"switch in bar: ($switch)"
}

def foo [--switch] {
    print $"switch in foo: ($switch)"
    bar --switch=(not $switch)
}
```

## Need help to wrap... commands? [[toc](#table-of-content)]
In the previous release, the `extern-wrapped` command has been deprecated and it is
[now being removed](#removed-commands-toc).
An issue did persist though, making `def --wrapped` not a suitable replacement for the old command...
which was fixed in [#11235](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/11235) by the changes from
[@KAAtheWiseGit](https://github.com/KAAtheWiseGit): `def --wrapped` commands won't create a help
page anymore, allowing to send `-h` and `--help` to other commands:
```nushell
def --wrapped foo [...rest] { echo $rest }
foo --help -h
```
will give no help page
```
─┬──────
0│--help
1│-h
─┴──────
```

## Redirection to standard streams is getting better [[toc](#table-of-content)]
Once again, [@WindSoilder](https://github.com/WindSoilder) has been working on the redirection
system of Nushell, fixing a bug and adding a new very nice feature:
- [#10851](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/10851): one pipeline output stream can be
    redirected and the other one used as input to the rest of the pipe
    Given the following Bash script called `foo.sh` that outputs both to _stdout_ and _stderr_
    ```sh
    echo aaaaa
    echo bbb 1>&2
    echo cc
    ```
    it is now possible to run the following command, redirecting `bbb` to the a file and the rest
    to the `lines | each { ... }` part of the pipeline:
    ```nushell
    bash test.sh err> err.txt | lines | each { str length}
    ```
    resulting in `[5, 2]` as expected and `bbb` inside `err.txt`.
- [#10764](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/10764): append to file with the `>>` syntax
    instead of overwriting with `>`
    ```nushell
    (1 + 2 + 3) out> sum.txt
    "\n" out>> sum.txt
    (4 + 5 + 6) out>> sum.txt
    ```
    will create a file called `sum.txt` with the following content
    ```
    6
    15
    ```

## Restricting use of internal variables [[toc](#table-of-content)]
Nushell features some internal variables that users can't redeclare, i.e. `$nu`, `$env` and `$in`.
::: tip Note
`$env` is the special of the three because one can mutate it with
```nushell
$env.FOO = "i'm foo"
```
but it is impossible to do `let env = 123`
:::

However, up until now and the work of [@KAAtheWiseGit](https://github.com/KAAtheWiseGit)
in [#11169](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/11169) and
[#11228](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/11228), it was possible to redefined these variables
in command definition, the code would parse and run but you would get the internal values instead of
the ones passed to the command, which is a nasty silent bug!
From now on, the following will give an error
```nushell
def foo [nu] { print $nu }
```
```nushell
def bar [env] { print $env }
```
```nushell
def baz [in] { print $in }
```

Also, because `$nu` and `$env` don't have spans by construction, i.e. they are not defined in any
script where a span would make sense but rather internally when Nushell starts, accessing there
`metadata` does not make sense. This release makes the error more helpful:
```nushell
metadata $env
```
```
Error:   × Built-in variables `$env` and `$nu` have no metadata
   ╭─[entry #1:1:1]
 1 │ metadata $env
   ·          ──┬─
   ·            ╰── no metadata available
   ╰────
```

## A small update on the LSP [[toc](#table-of-content)]
[@schrieveslaach](https://github.com/schrieveslaach) has been working again on the built-in LSP of
Nushell.
With [#10941](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/10941), completions should get better with
this release :partying:

## One-time theming of tables is there [[toc](#table-of-content)]
A common question and feature request from the community was: _how can i change the theme of Nushell
tables for just one command?_

Because of how Nushell works, the way to do that has been the following for a long time
```nushell
do {                                # use the scope of `do` to not alter the environment of the callee
    $env.config.table.mode = "none" # set the theme
    ls | table                      # call table to avoid just passing the value back to the callee and use the outside theme
}
```

In [#11058](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/11058), [@zhiburt](https://github.com/zhiburt)
cracked the nut and added the long-wanted `table --theme` option. Below is a simple example:
- let's define a table
```nushell
let table = ls | where type == dir | reject type
```
- and show it with a particular theme
```nushell
$table | table --theme ascii_rounded
```
```

## Parsing human-friendly dates into Nushell values [[toc](#table-of-content)]
In [#11051](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/11051), [@fdncred](https://github.com/fdncred)
added to `into datetime` the ability to parse _human readable_ dates into Nushell `datetime`.
This allows to write crazy things like
```nushell
"Now" | into datetime        # same as `date now`
"A week ago" | into datetime # same as `(date now) - 1wk`
```

::: tip Note
see the full list of examples with `into datetime --list-human`

## New "out of bound" error [[toc](#table-of-content)]
[@nibon7](https://github.com/nibon7) introduces in
[#11201](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/11201) a new error which is
pretty common to programming languages: the "out of bound" error.

This will cause the following command to give an "out of bound" error:
```nushell
"foo" | str index-of '' --range 10..11
```

## Exposing name of script to the wild [[toc](#table-of-content)]
Coming from languages such as Python and Bash, it's quite expected to be able to access the name of
the script itself the same way it's been called from the CLI: with `sys.argv[0]` in Python and `$0`
in Bash.

This was not possible in Nushell until the work of [@p00f](https://github.com/p00f) in
[#11203](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/11203).
This will expose to any script a new environment variable called `$env.PROCESS_PATH` and which will
contain precisely something akin to `argv[0]`!
```nushell
#!/usr/bin/env nu
# in demo.nu

def main [] {
    printf $"I was called as ($env.PROCESS_PATH)"
}
```
```nushell
demo.nu          # will show "I was called as demo.nu"
./demo.nu        # will show "I was called as ./demo.nu"
/path/to/demo.nu # will show "I was called as /path/to/demo.nu"
```

## Our set of commands is evolving [[toc](#table-of-content)]
As usual, new release rhyms with changes to commands!

### New commands [[toc](#table-of-content)]
- `is-terminal` by [@drbrain](https://github.com/drbrain) in [#10970](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/10970)
- `std null-devide` by [@WindSoilder](https://github.com/WindSoilder) in [#11070](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/11070)
- `mktemp` by [@tskinn](https://github.com/tskinn) in [#11005](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/11005)
- `stor` by [@fdncred](https://github.com/fdncred) in [#11170](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/11170) => see the [section below](#a-local-in-memory-database-with-stor)

#### A local in-memory database with `stor`

With this release we've implemented a new sqlite family of commands called `stor`. `stor` is meant to be short for "storing data in an in-memory sqlite database". That's right, this family of commands supports an _in-memory_ database. This in-memory database will be accessible as long as they share the same executable instance. A new instance is created with each new nushell instance and the in-memory database cannot be shared between instances. We're exited to see what new things you'll invent with this technology, although we still consider it in the experimental phase. Please feel free to submit PRs to make the usage of it better and more robust. There are examples of how to use each command [in the PR](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/11170).

Here the summary you get when you execute the `stor` command.
```nushell
Usage:
  > stor

Subcommands:
  stor create - Create a table in the in-memory sqlite database
  stor delete - Delete a table or specified rows in the in-memory sqlite database
  stor export - Export the in-memory sqlite database to a sqlite database file
  stor import - Import a sqlite database file into the in-memory sqlite database
  stor insert - Insert information into a specified table in the in-memory sqlite database
  stor open - Opens the in-memory sqlite database
  stor reset - Reset the in-memory database by dropping all tables
  stor update - Update information in a specified table in the in-memory sqlite database

Flags:
  -h, --help - Display the help message for this command

Input/output types:
  ╭─#─┬──input──┬─output─╮
  │ 0 │ nothing │ string │
  ╰───┴─────────┴────────╯
```

### Changes to existing commands [[toc](#table-of-content)]
- thanks to [@KAAtheWiseGit](https://github.com/KAAtheWiseGit) in [#11195](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/11195), `inpust list` will accept more input/output types
- the `list<string> -> string` I/O pair has been added to the `last` command by [@amtoine](https://github.com/amtoine) in [#11137](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/11137)
- with the work of [@IanManske](https://github.com/IanManske) in [#11258](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/11258), `insert`, `update` and `upsert` should now work more consistently with `list`s, e.g.
```nushell
[0, 2] | update 0 {|i| $i + 1 }  # will give [1, 2]
[0, 1, 2] | insert 5 5           # will give "index too large" error
```

### Deprecated commands [[toc](#table-of-content)]
- `std clip` in [#11097](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/11097): this command was handy but did not fit the [philosophy of the standard library](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/tree/main/crates/nu-std#--welcome-to-the-standard-library-of-nushell--)
- `std testing` in [#11151](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/11151): even though in a VERY EARLY stage of its development, we would like to focus our efforts on the [Nupm](https://github.com/nushell/nupm) project and especially its simple `nupm test` command

### Removed commands [[toc](#table-of-content)]
as part of the [deprecation plan of last release](https://www.nushell.sh/blog/2023-11-14-nushell_0_87_0.html#deprecated-commands-toc),
the following commands and options have been removed by [@amtoine](https://github.com/amtoine):
