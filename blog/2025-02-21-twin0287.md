# This week in Nushell #287

Published Friday, 2025-02-21

## Highlights

With this week's TWiN, we start reporting on a few more repositories. That is, commits to almost _all_
[Nushell repos](https://github.com/nushell) will now be included in your curated weekly reading below.

Changes in recent nightlys and main include additional use of the new Custom Attributes feature to assign
a category to your custom commands. You _did_ read about Custom Attributes in last week's TWiN, right?!

Also, @fdcred brought the latest Reedline into Nushell, so the new Vi-mode features you read about last week
are now available for dogfooding.

Last, but not least, thanks to @Kissaki for improving multiple codeblocks throughout the doc this week!
