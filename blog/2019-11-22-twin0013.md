# This week in Nu #13

Lucky #13! Welcome to our 13th edition of "This Week in Nu".

- We've just begun to create new websites. You can see the early versions live at [www.nushell.sh](http://www.nushell.sh) and [blog.nushell.sh](http://blog.nushell.sh). If you'd like to help or share your feedback, we'd love to have it! Big thanks to sebastian-xyz for kicking this off!
- wycats landed a rewrite of how column-paths work, improved debugging, and added a new `what?` command to help with debugging commands from inside of Nu ([#986](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/986))
- drmason13 has been cleaning up some of our csv/tsv handling logic ([#990](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/990))
