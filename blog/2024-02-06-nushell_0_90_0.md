# Nushell 0.90.1

Nushell, or Nu for short, is a new shell that takes a modern, structured approach to your command line. It works seamlessly with the data from your filesystem, operating system, and a growing number of file formats to make it easy to build powerful command line pipelines.

<!-- TODO: write this excerpt -->

Today, we're releasing version 0.90.1 of Nu. This release adds new completion menu improvements, unifies how globbing works across commands, and improves many existing commands.

# Where to get it

Nu 0.90.1 is available as [pre-built binaries](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/releases/tag/0.90.1) or from [crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/nu). If you have Rust installed you can install it using `cargo install nu`.

::: tip Note
The optional dataframe functionality is available by `cargo install nu --features=dataframe`.
:::

As part of this release, we also publish a set of optional plugins you can install and use with Nu. To install, use `cargo install nu_plugin_<plugin name>`.

## New Reedline coolness

We have some exciting new improvements in our line editor, thanks to [unprecedented number of contributions](https://github.com/nushell/reedline/releases/tag/v0.29.0) since the last release.

First, the matching prefix of a completion is now highlighted (note that this doesn't work with fuzzy completions yet):

![image](https://github.com/nushell/nushell.github.io/assets/343840/2d05a1e3-fb9a-4db9-94dd-63f2679a733b)

Second, completion menus now have more of an IDE feel to them (activated by Ctrl+N) [#11593](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/11593)

![image](https://github.com/nushell/nushell.github.io/assets/343840/1e15a21e-2d3b-42c3-b0db-80a49f6b593d)

Third, shift navigation ([#11535](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/11535)) now allows selecting and pasting text by holding the Shift key:

![select2](https://github.com/nushell/nushell.github.io/assets/343840/2e7c9bea-c4eb-47b3-8787-94a875603476)

All the new changes are configurable: See the [changes to the default config file](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/compare/0.89.0...main#diff-5c0320ebb54cd8ffd7059eb0178377c5139877d21457f6903439e7caf2e5b40e) (if the link does not bring you to the `default_config.nu` file, click the "Files changed" tab, then search for "default_config.nu" and open the diff) to see what has changed.

## (Breaking Change!) Handling globs

From this release, we unified glob rules for the following commands: `open`, `rm`, `cp`, `umv`, `mv`, `du`, `ls` ([#11621](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/11621)).

The general rules is: If given parameter is quoted by single quote(') or double quote("), don't auto-expand the glob pattern ([#11569](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/11569)).
If not quoted (or using backtick quote<code>`</code>), the glob pattern is auto-expanded.

So if you have the following files: `aac.txt`, `abc.txt`, `a[ab]c.txt`, then:

- `ls a[ab]c.txt` matches `aac.txt`, `abc.txt`
- `rm "a[bc]c.txt"` removes a file named `a[bc]c.txt`
- <code>ls `C:\Program Files\a[ab]c.txt`</code> matches `aac.txt`, `abc.txt`

But if you save a file name in a variable, e.g: `let f = "a[ab]c.txt"`, then `ls $f` matches `aac.txt`, `abc.txt`.
To escape the glob pattern to match a file named `a[bc]c.txt`, `str escape-glob` comes to play: `ls ($f | str escape-glob)`.

The new `str escape-glob` command ([#11663](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/11664)) is useful when you want to prevent globs from expanding, for example when using a closure: `ls | str escape-glob name | each {|it| ls $it.name }`, so you won't get error occasionally.

## (Breaking Change!) For existing plugin

Nushell allows plugins to receive configuration from the nushell configuration [#10955](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/10955), the communication protocol between nushell and plugin have changed to achieve the behavior.  So plugins need to update `nu-plugin` dependency version and recompile it to make plugin works again.

## Starting a new [Language Reference](https://www.nushell.sh/lang-guide)

Recently, we started a new reference page for Nushell language and its features.
For years, we have used the [current book](https://www.nushell.sh/book) as both a reference point for Nushell's features _and_ a tutorial.
The result is that it is too verbose to be used as a quick reference page, and due to its exhaustiveness it is also hard to keep concise as a tutorial.
The story-like writing style makes it also harder to keep up to date.
Over time, we hope to offload content from the book to the reference page that should be less verbose and easier to update.
At the same time, we aim to refactor the book into more of a tutorial style and make it more coherent.
Practical recipes for solving common problems continue being collected in the [cookbook](https://www.nushell.sh/cookbook).

## Parse-time evaluation

String interpolation can be now performed at parse time [#11562](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/11562).
This gives you another way to, for example, compose files for importing or sourcing, for example:

```nushell
const name = "spam"
use ($nu.default-config-dir | path join $"($name).nu")
```

The `ansi` commands now can also be evaluated at parse time: [#11682](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/11682)

## Integration of more [uutils](https://github.com/uutils/coreutils) commands

Continuing our cooperation with uutils, we now have a new `umv` command, implemented by uutils, which will replace our current `mv` [#10822](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/10822).

Our `old-cp` was also removed [#11622](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/11622) and now we rely solely on `cp` from `uutils`

## Dataframes: allow specifying schema ([#11634](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/11634))

The `dfr into-df` command can now accept a schema. A new `dfr schema` command can be used to view the schema:

```
> {a:1, b:{a:2}} | dfr into-df -s {a: u8, b: {a: i32}} | dfr schema
╭───┬─────────────╮
│ a │ u8          │
│   │ ╭───┬─────╮ │
│ b │ │ a │ i32 │ │
│   │ ╰───┴─────╯ │
╰───┴─────────────╯
```

## New CLI flag: `--no-history` ([#11550](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/11550))

If nushell is launched with the `--no-history` CLI flag, then command history file will not be read from or written to.
You can check whether history is enabled using `$nu.history-enabled`.
It will be false if `--no-history` was provided and true otherwise.

## Strict JSON parsing ([#11592](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/11592))

The `from json` command now has a `--strict` flag which will error on invalid JSON.
For example, comments and trailing commas are not allowed in JSON,
and so will trigger an error with the `--strict` flag.

## Our set of commands is evolving [[toc](#table-of-content)]

As usual, new release rhyms with changes to commands!

### New commands [[toc](#table-of-content)]

Apart from commands already mentioned above, [`into cell-path`](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/11322) can now be used to create cell paths dynamically.
