# Highlights and themes of this release [[toc](#table-of-content)]

## Simplified Startup Configuration [[toc](#table-of-content)]

With [#14249](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/14249), Nushell now always loads its internal `default_env.nu` before the user `env.nu` is loaded, then loads the internal `default_config.nu` before the user's `config.nu` is loaded. This allows for a simpler user-configuration experience. Details are in [this blog entry](https://www.nushell.sh/blog/2024-12-04-configuration_preview.html) along with an updated [Configuration Chapter](https://www.nushell.sh/book/configuration.html) which should go live sometime today.

### Related Startup Config Changes [[toc](#table-of-content)]

- [#14345](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/14345): Hooks fields are non-optional
- [#14341](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/14341): Hooks now default to an empty value of the proper type (e.g., `[]` or `{}`) when not otherwise specified. This means that you can always safely append or merge a new hook without first needing to check if it was a valid list/record.
- [#14435](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/14435): An `$env.config` is always created at startup, populated with default values, even when no configuration files are loaded.
- [#14549](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/14549): The `const` version of `NU_LIB_DIRS` is now populated by default instead of `$env.NU_LIB_DIRS`.
- [#14553](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/14553): The `const` version of `NU_PLUGIN_DIRS` is now populated by default instead of `$env.NU_PLUGIN_DIRS`.
- [#14566](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/14566): `ENV_CONVERSIONS` is now an empty record by default. The `PATH`/`Path` conversions are handled internally.
- [#14579](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/14579): More defaults are set in Rust. Also sets a default, empty `TRANSIENT_PROMPT_COMMAND_RIGHT` and `TRANSIENT_PROMPT_MULTILINE_INDICATOR`.

### Breaking Startup Config Changes [[toc](#table-of-content)]

There may be (hopefully) minor breaking changes due to the startup configuration handling. Known possible issues include:

- Cannot merge changes to default menus since their definitions are no longer in `config.nu` by default. Instead, the entire menu should be redefined.
- Querying the `$env.NU_LIB_DIRS` will return an empty result by default. Query the constant `$NU_LIB_DIRS` instead.

<!-- NOTE: if you wanna write a section about a breaking change, when it's a very important one,
    please add the following snippet to have a "warning" banner :)
    > see [an example](https://www.nushell.sh/blog/2023-09-19-nushell_0_85_0.html#pythonesque-operators-removal)

# Changes [[toc](#table-of-content)]

## Additions [[toc](#table-of-content)]

### `path self` [[toc](#table-of-content)]

Thanks to [@Bahex](https://github.com/Bahex) in [#14303](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/14303), this release adds the `path self` command. `path self` is a parse-time only command for getting the absolute path of the source file containing it, or any file relative to the source file.

```nushell
const this_file = path self
const this_directory = path self .
```

### `chunk-by` [[toc](#table-of-content)]

This release adds a new `chunk-by` command which will split a list into chunks based on a closure. The closure is applied to each element of the input list, and adjacent elements that share the same closure result value will be chunked together. This command was added in [#14410](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/14410) thanks to [@cosineblast](https://github.com/cosineblast).

```nu
# chunk by a predicate
[1 3 -2 -2 0 1 2] | chunk-by {|x| $x >= 0 }
# [[1 3] [-2 -2] [0 1 2]]

# chunk duplicate, adjacent elements together
[a b b c a a] | chunk-by { $in }
# [[a] [b b] [c] [a a]]
```

### `term query` [[toc](#table-of-content)]

Thanks to [@Bahex](https://github.com/Bahex) in [#14427](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/14427), this release adds the `term query` command.
`term query` allows sending a query to your terminal emulator and reading the reply.

```nushell
# Get cursor position
term query (ansi cursor_position) --prefix (ansi csi) --terminator 'R'

# Get terminal background color.
term query $'(ansi osc)10;?(ansi st)' --prefix $'(ansi osc)10;' --terminator (ansi st)

# Read clipboard content on terminals supporting OSC-52.
term query $'(ansi osc)52;c;?(ansi st)' --prefix $'(ansi osc)52;c;' --terminator (ansi st)
```

### `merge deep` [[toc](#table-of-content)]

To merge nested record structures we now have `merge deep` as a subcommand of `merge` which only operates on the flat structure of tables.

Here you can see how it is used to update a record with fields from a given record, by either adding the fields or replacing those leaf nodes that share a common cellpath.
```nushell
{a: {foo: 123 bar: "overwrite me"}, b: [1, 2, 3]} | merge deep {a: {bar: 456, baz: 789}, b: [4, 5, 6]}
# => ╭───┬───────────────╮
# => │   │ ╭─────┬─────╮ │
# => │ a │ │ foo │ 123 │ │
# => │   │ │ bar │ 456 │ │
# => │   │ │ baz │ 789 │ │
# => │   │ ╰─────┴─────╯ │
# => │   │ ╭───┬───╮     │
# => │ b │ │ 0 │ 4 │     │
# => │   │ │ 1 │ 5 │     │
# => │   │ │ 2 │ 6 │     │
# => │   │ ╰───┴───╯     │
# => ╰───┴───────────────╯
```

While the record entries get updated based on the path, by default lists at a given path are updated by replacement.

`merge deep` also has different strategies for merging inner lists and tables. For example, you can use the `append` strategy to _merge_ the inner `b` list instead of overwriting it.

```nushell
{a: {foo: 123 bar: "overwrite me"}, b: [1, 2, 3]} | merge deep --strategy=append {a: {bar: 456, baz: 789}, b: [4, 5, 6]}
# => ╭───┬───────────────╮
# => │   │ ╭─────┬─────╮ │
# => │ a │ │ foo │ 123 │ │
# => │   │ │ bar │ 456 │ │
# => │   │ │ baz │ 789 │ │
# => │   │ ╰─────┴─────╯ │
# => │   │ ╭───┬───╮     │
# => │ b │ │ 0 │ 1 │     │
# => │   │ │ 1 │ 2 │     │
# => │   │ │ 2 │ 3 │     │
# => │   │ │ 3 │ 4 │     │
# => │   │ │ 4 │ 5 │     │
# => │   │ │ 5 │ 6 │     │
# => │   │ ╰───┴───╯     │
# => ╰───┴───────────────╯
```

This command is the work of a productive collaboration by [@132ikl](https://github.com/132ikl) and [@Bahex](https://github.com/Bahex).

### `utouch` [[toc](#table-of-content)]

This release adds the new `utouch` command, utilizing uutils/coreutils! In addition to all the flags of `touch`, `utouch` also has a `--timestamp` and `--date` flag to specify the timestamp to use. Eventually, the `utouch` command will replace the `touch` command.

### WASM support [[toc](#table-of-content)]

Nushell used to have WASM support a while back, but at some point became incompatible with WASM. Thanks to the amazing work of [@cptpiepmatz](https://github.com/cptpiepmatz) in [#14418](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/14418), Nushell can now be compiled to WASM again! In order to do so, certain (cargo) features have to be disabled meaning certain commands (like filesystem commands) will not be available.

### `sys net` columns [[toc](#table-of-content)]

Thanks to [@rfaulhaber](https://github.com/rfaulhaber) in [#14389](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/14389), the `sys net` command now has two additional columns. One is the `mac` column which lists mac address. The other is the `ip` column which lists the address(es) for each network interface.

### Raw string pattern matching [[toc](#table-of-content)]

With this release, raw strings can now be used as match patterns thanks to [@sgvictorino](https://github.com/sgvictorino) in [#14573](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/14573).

```nu
match 'foo' {
    r#'foo'# => true
    _ => false
}
```

### Duration/Date Arithmetic [[toc](#table-of-content)]

With [#14295](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/14295), dates can now be added to durations. Previously only durations could be added to dates.

### `explore` keybinds [[toc](#table-of-content)]

In [#14468](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/14468) thanks to [@paulie4](https://github.com/paulie4), more default keybindings were added to `explore` to better match `less`.

### Version in Startup banner [[toc](#table-of-content)]

With [#14625](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/14625), the Nushell version now displays at startup in the banner.

### `input --default` [[toc](#table-of-content)]

Thanks to [@WindSoilder](https://github.com/WindSoilder) in [#14374](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/14374), the `input` command now has a `--default` parameter to set a default value when none is provided in the input.

### PowerShell script invocation on Windows [[toc](#table-of-content)]

With [#14379](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/14379) by [@fdncred](https://github.com/fdncred) we now launch PowerShell scripts with a `.ps1` extension directly through `powershell.exe`. This behavior follows the same logic we offer for scripts launched by `cmd.exe`.

### New introspection tools [[toc](#table-of-content)]

[@fdncred](https://github.com/fdncred) added a series of new tools permitting you to inspect internals of Nushell's engine for better understanding or debugging. We hope you can put them to good use to drill down into bugs or to learn more how the Nushell engine understands a piece of code or represents your current state. As they refer to the engine internals we still want to actively evolve their output or behavior may change as we continue development. So don't depend on them in scripts but feel free to use them to diagnose issues or learn about the behavior of the current version.

#### [`view source` now supports internal IDs](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/14609)
To access the content of closures or other code `view source` can now accept an integer ID which represents the internal `BlockId` to access the code stored there. This is useful whenever our output provided you with `<Closure {BlockID}>`. For closures stored in a variable you can still access it directly via `view source`.

#### [`view blocks`](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/14610)
This new commands lists the raw code blocks as stored in the engine after parsing including `block_id`, source code, and spans.

#### [`ast --flatten`](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/14400)
The `ast` command can now also output the flattened and simplified representation of the AST used by syntax highlighting and some of the completion logic. This is accessible through the `--flatten` flag.

#### [`config flatten`](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/14621)
To see the whole configuration in a simplified representation, especially to spot differences between different user configurations, `config flatten` provides a simplified view that is not nested like `$env.config`. Note that this output is not directly compatible with the config record and may not have the correct types.

## Breaking changes [[toc](#table-of-content)]

### `++` operator [[toc](#table-of-content)]

The `++` operator previously performed both appending and concatenation.

```nu
# Appending
[1 2 3] ++ 4 == [1 2 3 4]

# Concatenation
[1 2 3] ++ [4 5 6] == [1 2 3 4 5 6]
```

This created ambiguity when operating on nested lists:

```nu
[[1 2] [3 4]] ++ [5 6]
# Should this be [[1 2] [3 4] [5 6]] or [[1 2] [3 4] 5 6] ?
```

Additionally, the `++=` operator was able to change the type of a mutable a due to its dual role:

```nu
mut str: string = 'hello '
($str | describe) == string

$str ++= ['world']
($str | describe) == list<string>
```

After [#14344](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/14344), the `++` operator now only performs concatenation (between lists, strings, or binary values). To append a value to a list, either wrap the value in a list or use the `append` command.

```nu
mut list = [1 2]
$list ++= [3]
$list = $list | append 4
```

<!-- A helpful error message will be shown if you try to use `++` to append a value to a list.
TODO: waiting on #14429
-->

### Stricter command signature parsing [[toc](#table-of-content)]

#### Input/output types

Previous versions of Nushell would fail to parse input/output types on custom commands in some cases. However, a parse error would not be shown, making these silent parse errors.

```nu
# These input/output types are not valid, but no error would be shown:
def some_cmd [] -> string { '' }
def some_cmd [] : string { '' }

# Since the input/output types failed to parse, then this code would fail only at runtime:
(some_cmd) + 1
```

Thanks to [@ratherforky](https://github.com/ratherforky), this has been fixed in [#14510](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/14510). Invalid input/output types will now cause an error to be shown at parse-time.

```
# The custom commands above will now cause a parse error and should instead be:
def some_cmd []: any -> string { '' }
def some_cmd [] : any -> string { '' }

# This will now fail at parse-time due to type checking, before any user code is run:
(some_cmd) + 1
```

#### Custom command arguments

This release also makes the parsing for custom command arguments more strict thanks to
[@sgvictorino](https://github.com/sgvictorino) in [#14309](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/14309). For example, a colon (`:`) without a corresponding type is now an error. Below are some more examples of code snippets which are now parse errors.

```
# expected parameter or flag
def foo [ bar: int: ] {}

# expected type
def foo [ bar: =  ] {}
def foo [ bar: ] {}

# expected default value
def foo [ bar = ] {}
```

### `group-by` [[toc](#table-of-content)]

Thanks to [@Bahex](https://github.com/Bahex) in [#14337](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/14337), the `group-by` command now supports grouping by multiple criteria (henceforth referred to as a grouper). When using multiple groupers, the output is in the form of nested records.

```nu
let data = [
    [category color name];
    [fruit red apple]
    [fruit red strawberry]
    [vegetable red tomato]
    [fruit orange orange]
    [vegetable orange carrot]
    [vegetable orange pumpkin]
]

$data | group-by color category
```

```

```

With the `--to-table` flag, instead of nested records, the output is in the form of a table with columns corresponding to each grouper and the `items` column.
Each column corresponding to a `grouper` is named after it. For closure groupers, the columns are named with the scheme `closure_{i}`.

```nu
$data | group-by color category --to-table
```

The `timeit` command previously had a special behavior where expressions passed as arguments would have their evaluation deferred in order to later be timed. This lead to an interesting bug ([14401](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/issues/14401)) where the expression would be evaluated twice, since the new IR evaluator eagerly evaluates arguments passed to commands.

To make the deferred evaluation more explicit, the `timeit` command can now only take a closure as an argument instead of any expression or value ([#14483](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/14483)). Additionally, blocks are no longer supported by `timeit`, so any changes to the environment will be isolated to inside the closure.

### `sys cpu` [[toc](#table-of-content)]

The `cpu_usage` column outputted by `sys cpu` works by sampling the CPU over a 400ms period. This wait long time is unhelpful if you are only interested in other information about the CPU like the number of cores (i.e., `sys cpu | length`). With [#14485](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/14485), the `cpu_usage` column is now gated behind the `--long` flag. This way, `sys cpu` will take around 0-2ms instead of 400ms by default.

### `from csv` and `from tsv` [[toc](#table-of-content)]

Thanks to [@Bahex](https://github.com/Bahex) in [#14399](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/14399), parsing csv and tsv content with the `--flexible` flag is more flexible than before. Previously, the first row of csv or tsv content would determine the number of columns, and rows containing more values than the determined columns would be truncated, losing those extra values.

With this release, that is no longer the case. Now, `--flexible` flag means the number of columns aren't limited by the first row and can have not just less but also more values than the first row.

```csv
value
1,aaa
2,bbb
3
4,ddd
5,eee,extra
```

```nu
.. | from csv --flexible --noheaders
```

```
╭─#─┬─column0─┬─column1─┬─column2─╮
│ 0 │ value   │   ❎    │   ❎    │
│ 1 │       1 │ aaa     │   ❎    │
│ 2 │       2 │ bbb     │   ❎    │

│ 5 │       5 │ eee     │ extra   │
╰─#─┴─column0─┴─column1─┴─column2─╯
```

### `std/iter scan` [[toc](#table-of-content)]

Thanks to [@Bahex](https://github.com/Bahex) in [#14596](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/14596), the order of `scan`'s closure's parameters are flipped to be consistent with `reduce`.
The closure now also receives the accumulator value as pipeline input as well.

```nushell
> [a b c d] | iter scan "" {|x, y| [$x, $y] | str join} -n
# To keep its behavior same, this command should be changed to either of the following
> [a b c d] | iter scan "" {|it, acc| [$acc, $it] | str join} -n
> [a b c d] | iter scan "" {|it| append $it | str join} -n
```

### Completion sorting [[toc](#table-of-content)]

In [#14424](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/14424), some changes were made to completion sorting. If you have a custom completer that returns a record with an `options` field, then this may affect you.

- If `options` contains `sort: true`, then completions will be sorted according to `$env.config.completions.sort`. Previously, they would have been sorted in alphabetical order.
- If `options` contains `sort: false`, completions will not be sorted.
- If `options` does not have a `sort` column, then that will be treated as `sort: true`. Previously, this would have been treated as `sort: false`.

### Import module naming [[toc](#table-of-content)]

Thanks to [@sgvictorino](https://github.com/sgvictorino) in [#14353](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/14353), modules with special characters in their name will be normalized by converting these special characters to underscores (`_`). Previously, it was not possible to use these modules after importing them.

### `table` formatting and the `display_output` hook [[toc](#table-of-content)]
With [#14361](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/14361) by [@132ikl](https://github.com/132ikl) our machinery to format structured now follows a simpler logic.
If a `$env.config.hooks.display_output` hook is set, it is fully responsible for formatting the structured data, e.g. by invoking `table` with custom settings. Only if it is not set by `null` will `table` without arguments be run by default.
Previously the output logic would invoke `table` regardless on top of the formatting by your `display_output` hook. This avoids some spurious formatting attempts.

### `du` flag changes [[toc](#table-of-content)]

Thanks to [@WindSoilder](https://github.com/WindSoilder) in [#14407](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/14407), the `du` command shows a more condensed output by default. The `files` and (recursive) `directories` are not shown by default. Use `du --long (-l)` to show these columns. The `--all (-a)` switch has been removed -- Files and directories will both be shown with `--long (-l)`.

### Code specific environment variables updated during `source` [[toc](#table-of-content)]
The variables `$env.CURRENT_FILE` and `$env.FILE_PWD` had already been set to the respective file paths whenever a script was executed or module loaded. Similarly `$env.PROCESS_PATH` is set for the execution of a script or module but unset when a module is simply `use`d.

With [#14486](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/14486) by [@fdncred](https://github.com/fdncred) `$env.CURRENT_FILE` and `$env.FILE_PWD` will now also be updated when a particular file is included via `source`. Similarly `$env.PROCESS_PATH` will be unset.

```nushell
# test_source.nu
print $"$env.CURRENT_FILE = ($env.CURRENT_FILE?)"
print $"$env.FILE_PWD = ($env.FILE_PWD?)"
print $"$env.PROCESS_PATH = ($env.PROCESS_PATH?)"
```
``` nushell
source test_source.nu
# => $env.CURRENT_FILE = /Users/fdncred/src/nushell/test_source.nu
# => $env.FILE_PWD = /Users/fdncred/src/nushell
# => $env.PROCESS_PATH =
```

## Deprecations [[toc](#table-of-content)]

### `split-by` [[toc](#table-of-content)]

In [#14019](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/14019), the `split-by` command was deprecated. Instead, please use `group-by` with multiple groupers [as shown above](#group-by-toc).

### `date to-record` and `date to-table` [[toc](#table-of-content)]

In [#14319](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/14319):

- `date to-record` has been deprecated and will be removed in a future release. Please use `into record` in its place.
- `date to-table` has been deprecated and will be removed in a future release. Please use `into record | transpose | transpose -r` in its place.

### `do --ignore-shell-errors` and `--ignore-program-errors` [[toc](#table-of-content)]

Thanks to [@WindSoilder](https://github.com/WindSoilder) in [#14385](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/14385), `--ignore-shell-errors` and `--ignore-program-errors` for the `do` command have been deprecated. Use `--ignore-errors (-i)` instead.

## Removals [[toc](#table-of-content)]

### `NU_DISABLE_IR` [[toc](#table-of-content)]

With [#14293](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/14293), the `NU_DISABLE_IR` environment variable is no longer used. Nushell will now always use the new IR evaluator instead of previous AST based evaluator.

## Bug fixes and other changes [[toc](#table-of-content)]

### `ls` [[toc](#table-of-content)]

The `ls` command used to have deterministic output order, but this was broken in 0.94.0. Thanks to [@userwiths](https://github.com/userwiths) in [#13875](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/13875), `ls` output will now be sorted by the `name` column. Future changes to the order of `ls` will be a breaking change.

Additionally, thanks to [@sgvictorino](https://github.com/sgvictorino) in [#14310](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/14310), `ls` will now error if there are insufficient permissions to list the current working directory. Previously, `ls` would return empty output.

### `SHLVL` [[toc](#table-of-content)]

When starting Nushell as an interactive REPL, Nushell will now increment the `SHLVL` environment variable. This change was made in [#14404](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/14404) thanks to [@rikukiix](https://github.com/rikukiix). (Note that it is a known issue that `SHLVL` is still incremented on `exec`.)

### `from` commands [[toc](#table-of-content)]

After [#14602](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/14602), the `from` commands now remove the `content_type` pipeline metadata thanks to [@Bahex](https://github.com/Bahex).

### Completions on custom commands [[toc](#table-of-content)]

Thanks to [@RobbingDaHood](https://github.com/RobbingDaHood) in [#14481](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/14481), file completions are now triggered once again on custom commands after the first parameter. This was a regression due to the 0.99.x release.

### `seq char` [[toc](#table-of-content)]

Thanks to [@anomius](https://github.com/anomius) in [#14261](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/14261), `seq char` now works on any ASCII characters instead of only alphabetical ASCII characters.

### `http` multipart [[toc](#table-of-content)]

The `http` commands now use CRLF when joining headers to match the HTTP specification. This change was made in [#14417](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/14417) thanks to [@Beinsezii](https://github.com/Beinsezii).

### `scope variables` [[toc](#table-of-content)]

`scope variables` now lists constant variables in scope (when using the IR evaluator) thanks to [@sgvictorino](https://github.com/sgvictorino in [#14577](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/14577).

### `help` system [[toc](#table-of-content)]

[@132ikl](https://github.com/132ikl) fixed a long standing issue in the help system, where commands with the same name but different module paths clashed. Now the `help <name>` correctly refers to the name of a command like it is visible in the scope through the definitions or `use` imports thanks to [#14490](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/14490).

# Notes for plugin developers [[toc](#table-of-content)]

As part of cleaning up we removed several enum variants actually unused in the core codebase:

- `Type::ListStream` as the engine represents `PipelineData::ListStream` more consistently as `Type::List`
- `FlatShape::And`/`FlatShape::Or` as they are never populated.

Furthermore `Value::Filesize` now stores its value in its own `Filesize` type instead of a bare `i64` to avoid confusion about the particular unit.
