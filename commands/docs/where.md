# `where` for [filters](/commands/categories/filters.md)

<div class='command-title'>Filter values of an input list based on a condition.</div>

## Signature

```> where {flags} (condition)```

## Parameters

 -  `condition`: Filter row condition or closure.


## Input/output types:

| input     | output    |
| --------- | --------- |
| list&lt;any&gt; | list&lt;any&gt; |
| table     | table     |
| range     | any       |
## Examples

Filter rows of a table according to a condition
```nu
> [{a: 1} {a: 2}] | where a > 1
╭───┬───╮
│ # │ a │
├───┼───┤
│ 0 │ 2 │
╰───┴───╯

```

List only the files in the current directory
```nu
> ls | where type == file

```

List all files in the current directory with sizes greater than 2kb
```nu
> ls | where size > 2kb

```

List all files with names that contain "Car"
```nu
> ls | where name =~ "Car"

```

List all files that were modified in the last two weeks
```nu
> ls | where modified >= (date now) - 2wk

```

Filter items of a list with a row condition
```nu
> [1 2 3 4 5] | where $it > 2
╭───┬───╮
│ 0 │ 3 │
│ 1 │ 4 │
│ 2 │ 5 │
╰───┴───╯

```

Filter items of a list with a closure
```nu
> [1 2 3 4 5] | where {|x| $x > 2 }
╭───┬───╮
│ 0 │ 3 │
│ 1 │ 4 │
│ 2 │ 5 │
╰───┴───╯

```

Find files whose filenames don't begin with the correct sequential number
```nu
> ls | where type == file | sort-by name --natural | enumerate | where {|e| $e.item.name !~ $'^($e.index + 1)' } | get item

```

Find case-insensitively files called "readme", with a subexpression inside the row condition
```nu
> ls | where ($it.name | str downcase) =~ readme

```

Find case-insensitively files called "readme", with regex only
```nu
> ls | where name =~ '(?i)readme'

```

Filter rows of a table according to a stored condition
```nu
> let cond = {|x| $x.a > 1}; [{a: 1} {a: 2}] | where $cond
╭───┬───╮
│ # │ a │
├───┼───┤
│ 0 │ 2 │
╰───┴───╯

```

List all numbers above 3, using an existing closure condition
```nu
> let a = {$in > 3}; [1, 2, 5, 6] | where $a
╭───┬───╮
│ 0 │ 5 │
│ 1 │ 6 │
╰───┴───╯

```

## Notes
A condition is evaluated for each element of the input, and only elements which meet the condition are included in the output.

A condition can be either a "row condition" or a closure. A row condition is a special short-hand syntax to makes accessing fields easier.
Each element of the input can be accessed through the `$it` variable.

On the left hand side of a row condition, any field name is automatically expanded to use `$it`.
For example, `where type == dir` is equivalent to `where $it.type == dir`. This expansion does not happen when passing a subexpression or closure to `where`.

When using a closure, the element is passed as an argument and as pipeline input (`$in`) to the closure. Unlike row conditions, the `$it` variable isn't available inside closures.

Row conditions cannot be stored in a variable. To pass a condition with a variable, use a closure instead.
