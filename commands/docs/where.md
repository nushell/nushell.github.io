# `where` for [filters](/commands/categories/filters.md)

<div class='command-title'>Filter values based on a row condition.</div>

## Signature

```> where {flags} (row_condition)```

## Parameters

 -  `row_condition`: Filter condition.


## Input/output types:

| input     | output    |
| --------- | --------- |
| list\<any\> | list\<any\> |
| range     | any       |
| table     | table     |
## Examples

Filter rows of a table according to a condition
```nu
> [{a: 1} {a: 2}] | where a > 1
╭───┬───╮
│ # │ a │
├───┼───┤
│ 0 │ 2 │
╰───┴───╯

```

Filter items of a list according to a condition
```nu
> [1 2] | where {|x| $x > 1}
╭───┬───╮
│ 0 │ 2 │
╰───┴───╯

```

List all files in the current directory with sizes greater than 2kb
```nu
> ls | where size > 2kb

```

List only the files in the current directory
```nu
> ls | where type == file

```

List all files with names that contain "Car"
```nu
> ls | where name =~ "Car"

```

List all files that were modified in the last two weeks
```nu
> ls | where modified >= (date now) - 2wk

```

Find files whose filenames don't begin with the correct sequential number
```nu
> ls | where type == file | sort-by name --natural | enumerate | where {|e| $e.item.name !~ $'^($e.index + 1)' } | each {|| get item }

```

Find case-insensitively files called "readme", without an explicit closure
```nu
> ls | where ($it.name | str downcase) =~ readme

```

same as above but with regex only
```nu
> ls | where name =~ '(?i)readme'

```

## Notes
This command works similar to 'filter' but allows extra shorthands for working with
tables, known as "row conditions". On the other hand, reading the condition from a variable is
not supported.
