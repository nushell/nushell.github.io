# `timeit` for [debug](/commands/categories/debug.md)

<div class='command-title'>Time how long it takes a closure to run.</div>

## Signature

```> timeit {flags} (command)```

## Flags

 -  `--output, -o`: Include the closure output.

## Parameters

 -  `command`: The closure to run.


## Input/output types:

| input   | output                              |
| ------- | ----------------------------------- |
| any     | duration                            |
| nothing | duration                            |
| any     | record&lt;time: duration, output: any&gt; |
| nothing | record&lt;time: duration, output: any&gt; |
## Examples

Time a closure containing one command
```nu
> timeit { sleep 500ms }
500ms 631µs 800ns
```

Time a closure with an input value
```nu
> 'A really long string' | timeit { split chars }

```

Time a closure with an input stream
```nu
> open some_file.txt | collect | timeit { split chars }

```

Time a closure containing a pipeline
```nu
> timeit { open some_file.txt | split chars }

```

Time a closure and also return the output
```nu
> timeit --output { 'example text' }
╭────────┬──────────────╮
│ time   │ 14µs 328ns   │
│ output │ example text │
╰────────┴──────────────╯
```

## Notes
Any pipeline input given to this command is passed to the closure. Note that streaming inputs may affect timing results, and it is recommended to add a `collect` command before this if the input is a stream.

This command will bubble up any errors encountered when running the closure. The return pipeline of the closure is collected into a value and then discarded if `--output` is not set.
