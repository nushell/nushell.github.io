# `job send` for [experimental](/commands/categories/experimental.md)

<div class='command-title'>Send a message to the mailbox of a job.</div>

## Signature

```> job send {flags} (id)```

## Flags

 -  `--tag {int}`: A tag for the message

## Parameters

 -  `id`: The id of the job to send the message to.


## Input/output types:

| input | output  |
| ----- | ------- |
| any   | nothing |
## Examples

Send a message to a newly spawned job
```nu
> let id = job spawn { job recv | save sent.txt }; 'hi' | job send $id

```

## Notes

This command sends a message to a background job, which can then read sent messages
in a first-in-first-out fashion with `job recv`. When it does so, it may additionally specify a numeric filter tag,
in which case it will only read messages sent with the exact same filter tag.
In particular, the id 0 refers to the main/initial nushell thread.

A message can be any nushell value, and streams are always collected before being sent.

This command never blocks.
