List all overlays with their active status

│ 0 │ spam │ true   │
╰───┴──────┴────────╯

```

Get overlay status after hiding
```nu
> module spam { export def foo [] { "foo" } }
    overlay use spam
    overlay hide spam
    overlay list | where name == "spam"
╭───┬──────┬────────╮
│ # │ name │ active │
├───┼──────┼────────┤
│ 0 │ spam │ false  │
╰───┴──────┴────────╯

```

## Notes
The overlays are listed in the order they were activated. Hidden overlays are listed first, followed by active overlays listed in the order that they were activated. `last` command will always give the top active overlay
