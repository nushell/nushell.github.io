# `cd` for [filesystem](/commands/categories/filesystem.md)

<div class='command-title'>Change directory.</div>

## Signature

```> cd {flags} (path)```

## Flags

 -  `--physical, -P`: use the physical directory structure; resolve symbolic links before processing instances of ..

## Parameters

 -  `path`: The path to change to.


## Input/output types:

| input   | output  |
| ------- | ------- |
| nothing | nothing |
## Examples

Change to your home directory
```nu
> cd ~

```

Change to the previous working directory (same as "cd $env.OLDPWD")
```nu
> cd -

```

Changing directory with a custom command requires 'def --env'
```nu
> def --env gohome [] { cd ~ }

```

Move two directories up in the tree (the parent directory's parent). Additional dots can be added for additional levels.
```nu
> cd ...

```

The cd command itself is often optional. Simply entering a path to a directory will cd to it.
```nu
> /home

```
