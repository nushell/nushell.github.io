## Notes
Can import history from input, either successive command lines or more detailed records. If providing records, available fields are:
    command_line, id, start_timestamp, hostname, cwd, duration, exit_status.

If no input is provided, will import all history items from existing history in the other format: if current history is stored in sqlite, it will store it in plain text and vice versa.

Note that history item IDs are ignored when importing from file.
