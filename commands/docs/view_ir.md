# `view ir` for [debug](/commands/categories/debug.md)

<div class='command-title'>View the compiled IR code for a block of code.</div>

## Signature

```> view ir {flags} (target)```

## Flags

 -  `--json, -j`: Dump the raw block data as JSON (unstable).
 -  `--decl-id, -d`: Integer is a declaration ID rather than a block ID.

## Parameters

 -  `target`: The name or block to view compiled code for.


## Input/output types:

| input   | output |
| ------- | ------ |
| nothing | string |

## Notes
The target can be a closure, the name of a custom command, or an internal block
ID. Closure literals within IR dumps often reference the block by ID (e.g.
`closure(3231)`), so this provides an easy way to read the IR of any embedded
closures.

The --decl-id option is provided to use a declaration ID instead, which can be
found on `call` instructions. This is sometimes better than using the name, as
the declaration may not be in scope.
