<div class='command-title'>Copy a stream to another command in parallel.</div>

## Signature

```> tee {flags} (closure)```

## Flags

 -  `--stderr, -e`: For external commands: copy the standard error stream instead.

## Parameters

 -  `closure`: The other command to send the stream to.


## Input/output types:

| input | output |
| ----- | ------ |
| any   | any    |

## Examples

Save a webpage to a file while also printing it
```nu
> http get http://example.org/ | tee { save example.html }

```

Save error messages from an external command to a file without redirecting them
```nu
> nu -c 'print -e error; print ok' | tee --stderr { save error.log } | complete

```

Print numbers and their sum
```nu
> 1..100 | tee { each { print } } | math sum | wrap sum

```

Do something with a value on another thread, while also passing through the value
```nu
> 10000 | tee { 1..$in | print } | $in * 5
50000
```

## Notes
This is useful for doing something else with a stream while still continuing to
use it in your pipeline.
