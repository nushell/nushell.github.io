# `polars qcut` for [dataframe](/commands/categories/dataframe.md)

<div class='command-title'>Bin continuous values into discrete categories based on their quantiles for a series.</div>

::: warning This command requires a plugin
The `polars qcut` command resides in the `polars` plugin.
To use this command, you must install and register `nu_plugin_polars`.
See the [Plugins](/book/plugins.html) chapter in the book for more information.

## Signature

```> polars qcut {flags} (quantiles)```

## Flags

 -  `--labels, -l {list<string>}`: Names of the categories. The number of labels must be equal to the number of cut points plus one.
 -  `--left_closed, -c`: Set the intervals to be left-closed instead of right-closed.
 -  `--include_breaks, -b`: Include a column with the right endpoint of the bin each observation falls in. This will change the data type of the output from a Categorical to a Struct.
 -  `--allow_duplicates, -d`: If set, duplicates in the resulting quantiles are dropped, rather than raising an error. This can happen even with unique probabilities, depending on the data.

## Parameters

 -  `quantiles`: Either a list of quantile probabilities between 0 and 1 or a positive integer determining the number of bins with uniform probability.


## Input/output types:

| input | output |
| ----- | ------ |
| any   | any    |
## Examples

Divide a column into three categories according to pre-defined quantile probabilities.
```nu
> [-2, -1, 0, 1, 2] | polars into-df | polars qcut [0.25, 0.75] --labels ["a", "b", "c"]

```
