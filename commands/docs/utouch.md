# `utouch` for [filesystem](/commands/categories/filesystem.md)

<div class='command-title'>Creates one or more files.</div>

## Signature

```> utouch {flags} ...rest```

## Flags

 -  `--reference, -r {path}`: Use the access and modification times of the reference file/directory instead of the current time
 -  `--timestamp, -t {datetime}`: Use the given timestamp instead of the current time
 -  `--date, -d {string}`: Use the given time instead of the current time. This can be a full timestamp or it can be relative to either the current time or reference file time (if given). For more information, see https://www.gnu.org/software/coreutils/manual/html_node/touch-invocation.html
 -  `--modified, -m`: Change only the modification time (if used with -a, access time is changed too)
 -  `--access, -a`: Change only the access time (if used with -m, modification time is changed too)
 -  `--no-create, -c`: Don't create the file if it doesn't exist
 -  `--no-deref, -s`: Affect each symbolic link instead of any referenced file (only for systems that can change the timestamps of a symlink). Ignored if touching stdout

## Parameters

 -  `...rest`: The file(s) to create. '-' is used to represent stdout.
