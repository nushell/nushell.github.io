# `term query` for [platform](/commands/categories/platform.md)

<div class='command-title'>Query the terminal for information.</div>

## Signature

```> term query {flags} (query)```

## Flags

 -  `--prefix, -p {one_of(binary, string)}`: Prefix sequence for the expected reply.
 -  `--terminator, -t {one_of(binary, string)}`: Terminator sequence for the expected reply.
 -  `--keep, -k`: Include prefix and terminator in the output.

## Parameters

 -  `query`: The query that will be printed to stdout.


## Input/output types:

| input   | output |
| ------- | ------ |
| nothing | binary |

## Examples

Get cursor position.
```nu
> term query (ansi cursor_position) --prefix (ansi csi) --terminator 'R'

```

Get terminal background color.
```nu
> term query $'(ansi osc)10;?(ansi st)' --prefix $'(ansi osc)10;' --terminator (ansi st)

```

Get terminal background color. (some terminals prefer `char bel` rather than `ansi st` as string terminator)
```nu
> term query $'(ansi osc)10;?(char bel)' --prefix $'(ansi osc)10;' --terminator (char bel)

```

Read clipboard content on terminals supporting OSC-52.
```nu
> term query $'(ansi osc)52;c;?(ansi st)' --prefix $'(ansi osc)52;c;' --terminator (ansi st)

```

## Notes
Print the given query, and read the immediate result from stdin.

The standard input will be read right after `query` is printed, and consumed until the `terminator`
sequence is encountered. The `terminator` is not included in the output.

If `terminator` is not supplied, input will be read until Ctrl-C is pressed.

If `prefix` is supplied, input's initial bytes will be validated against it.
The `prefix` is not included in the output.
