# `ls` for [filesystem](/commands/categories/filesystem.md)

<div class='command-title'>List the filenames, sizes, and modification times of items in a directory.</div>

## Signature

```> ls {flags} ...rest```

## Flags

 -  `--all, -a`: Show hidden files
 -  `--long, -l`: Get all available columns for each entry (slower; columns are platform-dependent)
 -  `--short-names, -s`: Only print the file names, and not the path
 -  `--full-paths, -f`: display paths as absolute paths
 -  `--du, -d`: Display the apparent directory size ("disk usage") in place of the directory metadata size
 -  `--directory, -D`: List the specified directory itself instead of its contents
 -  `--mime-type, -m`: Show mime-type in type column instead of 'file' (based on filenames only; files' contents are not examined)
 -  `--threads, -t`: Use multiple threads to list contents. Output will be non-deterministic.

## Parameters

 -  `...rest`: The glob pattern to use.


## Input/output types:

```

Recursively list all files and subdirectories under the current directory using a glob pattern

Recursively list *.rs and *.toml files using the glob command
