# <code>{{ $frontmatter.title }}</code> for path

<div class='command-title'>{{ $frontmatter.path }}</div>

## Signature

```> path ```


## Input/output types:

| input   | output |
| ------- | ------ |
| nothing | string |

## Notes
You must use one of the following subcommands. Using this command as-is will only produce this help message.

There are three ways to represent a path:

* As a path literal, e.g., '/home/viking/spam.txt'
* As a structured path: a table with 'parent', 'stem', and 'extension' (and
* 'prefix' on Windows) columns. This format is produced by the 'path parse'
  subcommand.
* As a list of path parts, e.g., '[ / home viking spam.txt ]'. Splitting into
  parts is done by the `path split` command.

All subcommands accept all three variants as an input. Furthermore, the 'path
join' subcommand can be used to join the structured path or path parts back into
the path literal.
