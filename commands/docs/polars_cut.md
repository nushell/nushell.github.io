## Signature

```> polars cut {flags} (breaks)```

## Flags

 -  `--labels, -l {list<string>}`: Names of the categories. The number of labels must be equal to the number of cut points plus one.
 -  `--left_closed, -c`: Set the intervals to be left-closed instead of right-closed.
 -  `--include_breaks, -b`: Include a column with the right endpoint of the bin each observation falls in. This will change the data type of the output from a Categorical to a Struct.

## Parameters

 -  `breaks`: Dataframe that contains a series of unique cut points.


## Input/output types:

| input     | output    |
| --------- | --------- |
| dataframe | dataframe |
## Examples

Divide the column into three categories.
```nu
> [-2, -1, 0, 1, 2] | polars into-df | polars cut [-1, 1] --labels ["a", "b", "c"]

```
