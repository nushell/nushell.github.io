# `watch` for [filesystem](/commands/categories/filesystem.md)

<div class='command-title'>Watch for file changes and execute Nu code when they happen.</div>

## Signature

```> watch {flags} (path) (closure)```

## Flags

 -  `--debounce-ms, -d {int}`: Debounce changes for this many milliseconds (default: 100). Adjust if you find that single writes are reported as multiple events
 -  `--glob, -g {string}`: Only report changes for files that match this glob pattern (default: all files)
 -  `--recursive, -r {bool}`: Watch all directories under `<path>` recursively. Will be ignored if `<path>` is a file (default: true)
 -  `--quiet, -q`: Hide the initial status message (default: false)
 -  `--verbose, -v`: Operate in verbose mode (default: false)

## Parameters

 -  `path`: The path to watch. Can be a file or directory.
 -  `closure`: Some Nu code to run whenever a file changes. The closure will be passed `operation`, `path`, and `new_path` (for renames only) arguments in that order.


## Input/output types:

| input   | output |
| ------- | ------ |
| nothing | table  |

## Examples

Run `cargo test` whenever a Rust file changes
```nu
> watch . --glob=**/*.rs {|| cargo test }

```

Watch all changes in the current directory
```nu
> watch . { |op, path, new_path| $"($op) ($path) ($new_path)"}

```

Log all changes in a directory
```nu
> watch /foo/bar { |op, path| $"($op) - ($path)(char nl)" | save --append changes_in_bar.log }

```

Note: if you are looking to run a command every N units of time, this can be accomplished with a loop and sleep
```nu
> loop { command; sleep duration }

```
