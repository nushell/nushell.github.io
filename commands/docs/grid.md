A │ B │ C

Render a table with 'name' column in it to a grid

0.1.0 │ 0.1.1 │ 0.2.0

```

Render a table with 'name' column in it to a grid with icons and colors
```nu
> [[name patch]; [Cargo.toml false] [README.md true] [SECURITY.md false]] | grid --icons --color

```

## Notes
grid was built to give a concise gridded layout for ls. however,
it determines what to put in the grid by looking for a column named
'name'. this works great for tables and records but for lists we
need to do something different. such as with '[one two three] | grid'
it creates a fake column called 'name' for these values so that it
prints out the list properly.
