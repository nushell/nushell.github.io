## Examples

Render a simple list to a grid
```nu
> [1 2 3 a b c] | grid
1 │ 2 │ 3 │ a │ b │ c

```

The above example is the same as:
```nu
> [1 2 3 a b c] | wrap name | grid
1 │ 2 │ 3 │ a │ b │ c

```

Render a record to a grid
```nu
> {name: 'foo', b: 1, c: 2} | grid
foo

```

Render a list of records to a grid
```nu
> [{name: 'A', v: 1} {name: 'B', v: 2} {name: 'C', v: 3}] | grid
A │ B │ C

```

Render a table with 'name' column in it to a grid
```nu
> [[name patch]; [0.1.0 false] [0.1.1 true] [0.2.0 false]] | grid
0.1.0 │ 0.1.1 │ 0.2.0

```

## Notes
grid was built to give a concise gridded layout for ls. however,
it determines what to put in the grid by looking for a column named
'name'. this works great for tables and records but for lists we
need to do something different. such as with '[one two three] | grid'
it creates a fake column called 'name' for these values so that it
prints out the list properly.
