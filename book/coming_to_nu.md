# Coming to Nu

If you are familiar with other shells or programming languages, you might find this chapter useful to get up to speed.

[Coming from Bash](coming_from_bash.md) shows how some patterns typical for Bash, or POSIX shells in general, can be mapped to Nushell.

Similar comparisons are made for some [other shells and domain-specific languages](nushell_map.md), [imperative languages](nushell_map_imperative.md), and [functional languages](nushell_map_functional.md).
A separate comparison is made specifically for [operators](nushell_operator_map.md).
