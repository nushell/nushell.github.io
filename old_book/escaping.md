# Escaping to the system

Nu provides a set of commands that you can use across different OSes, and having this consistency is helpful. Sometimes, though, you want to run a command that has the same name as Nu commands. To run the local `ls` or `date` command, for example, you use the caret (^) command.

Nu command:

```
> ls
```

Escape to local command:

```
> ^ls
```
