### Nu works with existing data

Nu speaks [JSON, YAML, SQLite, Excel, and more](/book/loading_data.html) out of the box. It's easy to bring data into a Nu pipeline whether it's in a file, a database, or a web API:

### Nu has great error messages

Nu operates on typed data, so it catches bugs that other shells don't. And when things break, Nu tells you exactly where and why:
