## Setting Nu as login shell (Linux, BSD & macOS)

::: warning
Nu is not intended to be POSIX compliant.
Be aware that some programs on your system (or their documentation) might assume that your login shell is [POSIX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/POSIX) compatible.
Breaking that assumption can lead to unexpected issues. See [Configuration - Login Shell](./configuration.md#configuring-nu-as-a-login-shell) for more details.
:::

To set the login shell you can use the [`chsh`](https://linux.die.net/man/1/chsh) command.
Some Linux distributions have a list of valid shells located in `/etc/shells` and will disallow changing the shell until Nu is in the whitelist.
You may see an error similar to the one below if you haven't updated the `shells` file:

@[code](@snippets/installation/chsh_invalid_shell_error.sh)

You can add Nu to the list of allowed shells by appending your Nu binary to the `shells` file.
The path to add can be found with the command `which nu`, usually it is `$HOME/.cargo/bin/nu`.
