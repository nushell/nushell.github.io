# Running System (External) Commands

Nu provides a set of commands that you can use across different operating systems ("internal" commands) and having this consistency is helpful when creating cross-platform code. Sometimes, though, you want to run an external command that has the same name as an internal Nu command. To run the external [`ls`](/commands/docs/ls.md) or [`date`](/commands/docs/date.md) command, for example, preface it with the caret (^) sigil. Prefacing with the caret calls the external command found in the user's `PATH` (e.g. `/bin/ls`) instead of Nu's internal [`ls`](/commands/docs/ls.md) command).

Nu internal command:

```nu
ls
```

External command (typically `/usr/bin/ls`):

```nu
^ls
```

::: note
On Windows, `ls` is a PowerShell _alias_ by default, so `^ls` will not find a matching system _command_.

## Additional Windows Notes

When running an external command on Windows,
Nushell forwards some `CMD.EXE` internal commands to cmd instead of attempting to run external commands.
[Coming from CMD.EXE](coming_from_cmd.md) contains a list of these commands and describes the behavior in more detail.
