# Modules

Like many programming languages, Nushell supports writing and using _modules_ as a way to organize code more efficiently. Modules can be thought of as "containers" that hold various definitions, including:

- Additional custom commands
- Aliases
- Constants
- Externs
- Environment variables
- And even other modules (a.k.a., submodules)

Many users will start off using modules written by others, then progress to writing their own. This chapter covers those two topics:

- [Using Modules](./modules/using_modules.md)
- [Creating Modules](./modules/creating_modules.md)
